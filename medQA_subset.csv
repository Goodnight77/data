Q. What should I do to reduce my weight gained due to genetic hypothyroidism?,"Hi doctor, I am a 22-year-old female who was diagnosed with hypothyroidism (genetic) when I was 12. Over the past five years, I have become around 50 pounds overweight and all of my attempts to lose have seemed to fail so I have given up, but my weight has stayed the same. There is so much information put there about losing weight with hypothyroidism but it all seems to conflict. I am so unsure as to what type of exercise and diet I should follow as a result but I still would like to lose weight, but most importantly have my body feel better. What can I do? I am currently on Levothyroxine, Buspar, and Benedryl.","Hi. You have really done well with the hypothyroidism problem. Your levels are normal with less medications which are very good. As it is genetically induced, it is very difficult to lose weight. My advice to you is, you should focus on maintaining normal levels of TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) and try to remain active, having a positive outlook in life. Or else, it will become very difficult to balance your life with the symptoms of hypothyroidism. Even though your weight has not reduced, be very careful in not putting on weight here afterward. Everyday brisk walking for 1 hour. If you have body pain, alternate with exercises and walking. Avoid all kinds of junk foods, processed, bakery products, rich sweets, fatty foods, sodas, alcohol, and smoking. Avoid partying and binge eating. Follow the food timings properly. Have small frequent meals. In between snacks should be strictly fruits or any kind of low-calorie foods. Have unsalted nuts around five daily. It can give a glow to your dry skin. Everyday water intake should be around 1.5-2 liters. You can use flax seeds. Powder it and mix it in your food. It is a fiber which will give you fullness. Use turmeric, fenugreek seeds, or powder every day. It is a good antioxidant and fenugreek helps in reducing cholesterol levels. Include low-fat milk, curd every day. Egg white, lean chicken, or fish can be taken daily in moderation (anyone). Organ meats need to be avoided. Is your menstrual cycle normal? Please get back if you have any other complaints. Follow up after 15 days."
"Q. I have started to get lots of acne on my face, particularly on my forehead. Please help me.","Hi doctor! I used to have clear skin but since I moved to a new place, I started to have lots of acne on my face particularly on my forehead. I thought it would disappear once I went back home, but it only got worse. I did some research and assumed that it was caused by drinking too much cow's milk, but it has been since since I stopped and they would still not go away. I also noticed that I get deep acne whenever I'm nearing my period, along with the usual small red bumps. I bought an acne soap and have been using it for a month now but I'm not sure if it works. I hope you can help me because it has been affecting my mental state lately :((((",Hi there Acne has multifactorial etiology. Only acne soap does not improve if ypu have grade 2 or more grade acne. You need to have oral and topical medications. This before writing medicines i need to confirm your grade of acne. For mild grade topical clindamycin or retenoic acud derivative would suffice whereas for higher grade acne you need oral medicines aluke doxycycline azithromycin or isotretinoin.

Q. Why do I have uncomfortable feeling between the middle of my spine and left shoulder blade?,"Hello doctor,I am having an uncomfortable feeling in between the middle of my spine and left shoulder blade. It seems to get stiff, and my bones pop a lot around there, and it is very uncomfortable to sit in specific ways feels like my bones shift, well the other night it seemed as if my shoulder would pop out of place causing more stiffness after a while of dealing with it. I ended up feeling a popping sensation, where the stiffness was an instant relief. It was so shocking it put my anxiety through the roof. I thought I was going to die because my whole body was shaking and tingling. What am I dealing with? Right now I have no pain or tender near that area still relief but curious on what happened and why I got this shock and that popping feeling so loud it scared me half to death.","Hello. The popping and discomfort what you felt is either because of improper scapulothoracic mobility or may be due to facet joint irritation in the neck with intervertebral hypermobility. Which could have caused due to stiffness in the chest muscles, shoulder stiffness, etc.  I would recommend you to do a lot of icing in the chest and back muscles. Maintain your neck and upper back posture by doing some back retraction work. Gently stretch your neck and chest. Gently massage your chest and shoulders to relieve tension in the muscles. I hope this is helpful for now. Kindly revert in case you need any help in this regard."
Q. My symptoms after intercourse threatns me even after having negative HIV result. Kindly help.,"Hello doctor,Before two years had sex with a call girl in a dark location for about 10 to15 min. I did not eject, and I am sure that she did not eject as well (not 100 % sure). Do not know if the condom broke (as it was dark) but had some liquid on my penis (maybe fluid in condom, not sure) After few days from then I had cold followed by itchy skin. I took medicine from the doctor and got it resolved.After a few weeks from then, I had fever 100 F, mild night sweats, mild sore throat, slight weight loss (around four to five kg). Also I feel tired most of times. After 50 days, I got an HIV blood test, which came out negative. Do not know the name of the test, they took blood from my fingertip, tested it using some chemical for 40 minutes, and gave a report. Doctor suggested me get the same test after three months. Now I took medicines for flu symptoms which are giving me relief. But, very worried about the situation. Will medicine I used for cold and itchy skin have impact on HIV. Was the test enough for diagnosis as I do not know the name like fourth-generation etc. Also I washed my penis after 20 minutes with water thoroughly. Please help.","Hello. The HIV test uses a finger prick blood sample, with results given within 20 minutes, and is 99 % accurate at detecting any HIV exposure that may have occurred more than 12 weeks ago. However, it can potentially pick up HIV infection from as little as four weeks ago. There is nothing to worry nothing will happen, and please repeat your test after 12 weeks. If you want accurate results to get, it has done RNA PCR which will give actual results within 10days. Antigen detection like P24 gives best results with in two to four weeks. Probably your suffering from a simple viral upper respiratory infection. After 12 weeks, please consult your doctor he will examine and treat you accordingly."
Q. I had a surgery which ended up with some failures. What can I do to fix it?,"Hello doctor,I had an emergency surgery six months ago punched through a window right arm cut both arteries cut radial nerve with ulnar damage and cut bicep tendon nerves back now almost full thumbs up the only issue is bicep. My question is there something I can do to fix it like lengthening surgery, or am I stuck? I am a boxer supposed to go Olympics this year. My surgeon focused on the nerve and did not care help. PS pronator is still little and has not fully recovered.","Hello. If you are saying it is already six months since the surgery and if you are doing regular physiotherapy, still has not gained much of the actions, then it is not worth waiting anymore. There are many muscle transfer surgeries which can give you the desired movements and help you in day today activities. But you have to remember that post such operations you will require time to train the brain and get the full use of such movements. That will take time. Do not want to demotivate you, but tremendous training and hard work might be required to reach the pre trauma stage of your boxing."
Q. Kindly explain about Beta Strep.,"Hello doctor, My culture from my gynecologist came back, showing that I have a yeast infection as well as Beta Strep. I was hoping for more information on Beta Strep. I have never heard of it, and there is a lot of information when I searched that is making me confused a little. I am not experiencing any symptoms, either. I feel perfectly fine.","Hello. There are lots of bacteria and other organisms that colonize healthy skin. Yeast a fungus also is a commensal in our body. Just the presence of these organisms is of no significance. The colony count is needed, which is high, will need a course of antibiotics, which can be decided by culture and sensitivity. But after a surgery like what you had, or any significant stress or use of lots of antibiotics (as would have happened after surgery) or use of steroids or diabetes, all infections show an altered balance between good and bad bacteria. You do not need any treatment for this. Just wait for your body to develop those good bacteria, and gradually, all tests will come negative. If you have any symptoms, treat as per need. Avoid unnecessary antibiotics use. They will further delay the recovery. I hope I have clarified your query, do write back if any more questions."
Q. Kindly suggest a homeopathic medicine to stop hairfall and promote hair growth.,"Hello doctor,I am 24 years old, and for the past nine years, I am facing hair fall problem nowadays my 60 % of hair is falling on my top and front of my head. I checked my thyroid and hemoglobin many times, but their reports are good. I use many home remedies and hair oils, but when I stop using it again, it starts falling. The allopathic doctor says use Minoxidil 5 %, Finasteride, and hair serum. But Finasteride has many side effects. Can you please tell me is any medicine available in homeopathy which stops hair fall and promotes hair growth if yes can you please tell me the name.","Hello. I checked the attached photo (attachment removed to protect patient identity) and read your description. It seems you have been suffering from hair loss problem for a longtime. Do you eat healthy food like vegetables and fruits every day? Sometimes lack of nutrition is also the reason for hair loss. Do you know if your father also differed from hair loss issue at this young age? Did you suffer from severe health issues or chronic illnesses? If you do not think above mentioned is the cause for your hair fall, then the only reason I can think is that you have been going through severe stress which has taken a toll on your health. Homeopathy would be a good option in this case as it will cure our problem from the root cause, and there will be no side effects. So to prescribe you a correct homeopathic remedy I need to understand your mental, emotional, and physical state. He ce I need detail case history which can be done either through face to face consultation or online consultation. I would advise you to visit a good homeopath for consultation. For the time being, you can apply arnica hair oil twice a week on your hair. Just mix one spoon of Arnica oil with five spoons of coconut oil and apply all over your scalp. You can gently massage your ear with this mixture. Try this for 15 days and then let me know how you feel. I hope you start feeling better. Let me know if you have any questions."

Q. Will Kalarchikai cure multiple ovarian cysts in PCOD?,"Hello doctor, I have multiple small cysts in both ovaries (PCOS). Our family friend suggested me to consume Kalarchikai medicine, powdered mixed with pepper and honey to have it for one mandalam (48 days). I have completed nearly 44 days by consuming one small ball of the mixture every morning and before two weeks I got my periods.

Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well.","Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally. Medicine is not of much help."

Q. Can a painless tooth be extracted since it has a hole in it?,"Hello doctor,Can I pull out hard teeth out no pain because I got a hole in my teeth? Whenever I use to eat something, it got stuck in it and caused severe pain. Kindly give me some advice about pulling it out without any pain.","Hello. I had gone through your question, and I can understand your concern. If the pain occurs only when you eat food and it gets stuck into it, it is reversible pulpitis. For that, you do not need to get it extracted. You need to get it filled, and it will cost you less than that of pulling (extraction). Second, you will save your tooth too. My suggestion is to get dental filling done as soon as possible. If you want to get it removed, you need to visit a doctor (dentist), and there will be no pain because during extraction local anesthesia is given."

Q. I get fever during rainy and winter season. Why?,"Hello doctor, During rainy and winter season get frequent fevers. Most of the times I get it diagnosed, and every time doctors tell it is only viral fever. Fevers generally come twice a month. I take Paracetamol and Cefixime usually (on the advice of doctors). Generally, the illnesses go in 10 days. This has been happening from the last three years. Can you suggest any cure for it? I am a small time businessman, and this is affecting my financials. Regarding my medical history, I am a premature baby of seven months. As told by my mom and relatives, I remained alive on medicines with great difficulty. And also from childhood, I used to get skin diseases frequently, and for that, I think I was regularly administered antibiotics.","Hello. I need to know a few things, 1. Do you feel feverish, or does the thermometer record a temperature? 2. What other symptoms do you get? Runny or blocked nose, sore throat, throat pain with swallowing, headaches, body pains, etc. 3. Does anyone else around you (family members, co-workers, etc.) develop similar symptoms before or after you do? 4. Do you get any tests done like blood tests or X-rays during those episodes? From your description, it appears that you are getting frequent viral upper respiratory tract infections. These are acquired from other patients through the air (coughing, sneezing, etc.). They are usually short-lived and last no more than five to seven days. Since more than 300 different viruses can cause similar symptoms, you can get infected multiple times each time with a different virus. The same virus cannot affect you again. Unfortunately, antibiotics do not work against viruses. They are meant for bacterial infections only. However, doctors continue to prescribe antibiotics unnecessarily, and this has led to the emergence of widespread bacterial resistance.  Other than symptomatic treatment, no medicine can cure or prevent these infections. They are self-limited, and you will get better even if you do not take any medication. The older you get, the less frequently you will get these infections as your body will be building up defenses with every disease. No household tips or vitamin supplements have been proven to work. Premature birth can lead to increased frequency of infections, but unless the infections are bacterial, not much can be done about them. Please get back to me with answers to the above questions and also attach any test reports you may have."
Q. Why does one develop swelling after snake bite?,"Hi doctor, I am a 40 year old female. I got cottonmouth bite on the back of the left and right ankle. Three people saw and confirmed that as cottonmouth. I do not believe much venom was released. It happened under shallow water. I got immediate pain as if repeatedly the ankle and feet got hit with a bat and a burning swelling began quickly. I went to the ER. They monitored my blood for two hours and decided no antivenom. I was not given either a tetanus shot or any antibiotics. From the laboratory work, they said everything looks good, but I could not stand or walk. They sent me home with Ultram and Ibuprofen 800 mg. After two days, the swelling slightly increased instead of going down. My fiance took me to different hospitals. The swelling and the fang marks were evident. Again, the laboratory work came back as normal. I was still in pain and swollen ankles. They gave steroid IM injection and Prednisone pack and suggested antihistamine. It has been six days. Still, I cannot stand, walk or care for myself in any way. The swelling has not got down. I have kept it elevated and put some cool fabric packs on swollen areas. It seems to help with burning sensation. I have been drinking Echinacea tea, water and taking all medicines prescribed such as Ultram, Benadryl, Prednisone and Ibuprofen 800 mg. Back of my legs up to the thigh is swollen, entire legs hurt and tender to even minimal touch. Bruising has darkened and the swelling has not gone down. There are no red lines and no skin rotting. What shall I do now? I want the swelling to get relieved. I am scared. How to reduce the swelling? Please tell me what I need to do just to be able to stand briefly. The pain has subsided from 10 to 5, but if I try to stand by just keeping the foot down towards the floor, then the pain is excruciating. Please help.",Hi. I could understand your crisis.

The most common cause of proptosis is thyroid abnormality (hyperthyroidism) and called thyroid eye disease (TED). In this condition, eye muscle gets enlarged due to GAG (glycosaminoglycans) material deposition. This condition usually resolves after active and quiet phase that takes up to five to seven years. During this time the actual cause is treated (hyperthyroidism) and for proptosis steroids may be given (that you have already taken). Enlarged muscles can compress the optic nerve and can cause permanent vision loss. So you need to consult an endocrinologist for the treatment of thyroid abnormality. Quit smoking (if you are a smoker) and keep follow your eye doctor to avoid complication that can cause permanent vision loss. You are welcome for any queries."

Q. Suffering from subclinical hyperthyroidism with anxiety and palpitations.,"Dear Doctor, I am trying to figure out what is wrong with my 15 year old daughter. Her symptoms have developed most significantly over the past few months, and include depression, weakness, constant light-headedness, shortness of breath (even when sitting still), difficulty taking a deep breath (causes pain), episodes where breathing becomes especially difficult, a complete lack of energy, continual exhaustion, continual muscle soreness (especially in the calves), cold hands and feet (to the point of turning blue), intolerance to cold and heat especially, episodes of a racing heartbeat, and episodes of anxiety and disorientation. At first our focus was on her was depression but now our focus is shifting toward her problems with physical activity and breathing, especially as she has now come to the point where she can no longer participate in any sports. We have seen a psychiatrist for her depression who discovered the MTHFR Mutation, which has since been addressed with a megadose of methyl folate. After three weeks on the medication there has been no improvement. Her paediatrician tested her for asthma and the resultsÂ were negative. We have put her on various vitamin B supplements and have made sure she is getting proper nutrition and rest. Again, nothing has helped. Other labwork, as well as some of her symptoms, has made us consider her thyroid. The thyroid results are as follows:  TSH: 0.059 ulU/ml. AntioTPO-Ab: 84.9 IU/mL. Anti-Thyroglobulin: 134 IU/mL. Total T3: 130 ng/dL. T4: 10.5 ug/dL. Other labs that were out of the normal range are as follows: Â - Ferritin: 31 ng/mL (her other iron results were normal).Â - Differential (Audo Diff) Neutrophils: 66%. In spite of a low TSH we have been told that as long as the T4 level is within normal range there is no need for attention with the thyroid. Yet, I cannoÂ help but keep coming back to the thyroid and wonder if this is notÂ where we should focus our efforts. Any thoughts please?","Hi, It is really sad to know about your daughter. 1. As a matter of fact your daughter seems to have acute thyroiditis. Though the thyroid profile has not shown full blown thyrotoxic state, she has subclinical hyperthyroidism with TSH being suppressed. Since how long has she been like this? Thyroiditis might take 8-12 weeks to settle. How old are the reports? Thyroiditis might leave the patient hypothyroid. 2. Secondly she is 15, puberty is another phase of major hormonal and emotional change over. How are her periods? Has she put on weight? or lost some? You have supplemented with multivitamins, please see if B12 upto 1500 mcg is being given and Vitamin D 1000 IU daily or 60,000 IU once a week is going. Also supplement her with calcium and magnesium and check these levels as well. Treat her with Propranolol 10mg twice a day to beat the anxiety and palpitations.

Q. Is PAP test valid for screening prostatitis symptoms?,"Hi doctor, I asked my doctor to do PSA test. The PSA came back normal at 1.0 ng/mL. However, he also did prostatic acid phosphatase test which was high at 4.5 ng/mL. My question is whether prostatic acid phosphatase test is valid for screening or not? Should I need to do these tests again? I had prostatitis symptoms in the past. Now, it seems to be fine.","Hi. I have gone through your query. Prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP) has been replaced by PSA (prostate-specific antigen test). It is better in the detection of prostate cancer compared to PAP. The elevation of PAP levels alone is not a cause for concern. I hope your treating doctor has done a rectal exam to find out any prostate nodules. If it is normal, then it is not necessary to repeat the tests. Hope this helps you. Feel free to revert back with any questions. For more information consult an urologist online -->"
Q. Why is my free PSA abnormal?,"Hello doctor, 50 years old, 5.8 inches, 260 lbs. On blood pressure pills. My doctor is out of town for a few weeks. I reviewed PSA test results and apparently I have one abnormal reading out of three. PSA total 0.5, PSA free 0.1, PSA % free 20. The PSA % free 20 is in red indicating abnormal. What does this mean? What causes it to be abnormal?","Hi. Free PSA should be more than 15 % to rule out prostate cancer. Free PSA is an additional tool used when PSA is above 2.5 and we want to check whether high PSA is due to benign prostate growth or due to prostate cancer. Some laboratories use 25 % cutoff, but most have 15 % cutoff value. Since your total PSA is quite low and free PSA is above 15 %, you should not worry. If in doubt, repeat after a few months."
Q. I have frequent urination and minimal calcification. Does it mean prostate cancer?,"Hi doctor, I am 27 years old. I am worried about my prostate as my grandfather had prostate cancer and my father had an enlargement but was already cured. I had an ultrasound last year due to frequent urinating and result showed minimal calcification a year back. The Radiologist told me that the calcification has nothing to worry as it was not that serious and my doctor (internal medicine) also did not care about it. But I am still worried as what I have read is that even at a young age you can have prostate cancer. Though I am still experiencing frequent urination (I am now drinking a lot of water 2 to 3 liters a day) now, my creatinine is in normal level and KUB is all normal.","Hi. I have gone through your query. It is extremely unlikely for you to develop prostate cancer at your age. Even in families with hereditary prostate cancer, the usual age people develop cancer is above 40 years of age at the lowest, though it is usually between 50 to 60 years. That said, in your case, it is too early to jump to conclusions of having prostate cancer in your family. The most likely explanation for your symptoms could be a mild urinary tract infection or even your increased fluid intake. Prostatic calcification is commonly seen and does not imply anything significant to worry now. If you are concerned, you can do a PSA (prostate-specific antigen) test and a prostate exam at 40 years. If normal, then you can repeat it after three years interval. For more information consult an urologist online -->"
Q. Please enlighten me on non-invasive procedures to detect prostate cancer.,"Hello doctor, I am a 79 year old male. Excellent health, take no medications with the exception of an occasional Viagra. In a recent DRE, my urologist discovered two small nodules on my prostate. A PSA at the time was 6.3. Over the years, I have ranged in 2's and 3's. He suggested a biopsy of the prostate. I have read many negative things about this process. I have also read about nonevasive procedures to detect for cancer.","Hi. I have gone through your query. I concur with your urologist in the need for a biopsy. Any PSA (prostate-specific antigen) more than 4 or abnormal findings on DRE (digital rectal examination) needs evaluation to rule out prostate cancer. None of the non-invasive techniques are sufficiently accurate as a biopsy at present. The closest is an MRI which, if positive, needs to be confirmed by a biopsy, and if negative does not exactly rule out a malignancy, you will need a biopsy nevertheless. Many blood tests are available but those are only if the DRE is normal and will not be applicable in your situation. Hope this was helpful, feel free to revert back with any other questions.

Q. When should I stop Clexane and Ecosprin should before delivery?,"Hello doctor, Presently I am on my 34 th weeks of pregnancy. LMP was before eight months. I had an IUD of more than 37 weeks before two years. Present medications are Clexane 20, and Ecosprin 75 daily. As per my doctor's planning, I should go for C-section between 36 to 37 weeks. Now when I should stop my Claxene and Ecospirin? This medication is given by my gynecologist after analyzing my boh panel report which states lupus anticoagulant by DRVTT is 45.50. No lupus-like anticoagulant present, APTT is 31.30 and PTT-LA is 98.80. Kindly advice.","Hello.  I feel that it would be the best if you do not stop these medicines without the advice of your doctor who recommended these and made a plan for your pregnancy because self-treatment strategy will lead to no benefits. And both of these drugs are safe to use, so you do not have to worry. Furthermore, for your knowledge, aspirin is usually stopped at 35 to 36 weeks of pregnancy, and Clexane (Enoxaparin sodium) is being continued until delivery, and even after that. So I would again say that please take advice from your particular doctor before stopping any of these medications as your pregnancy is very precious. I hope it has helped you.

Q. Are my symptoms due to HIV infection? I had a high-risk exposure 15 months ago.,"Hi doctor, After 15 months of unprotected sex, I went for HIV test called Comb AIDS test but, the result came back negative for both HIV-1 and 2. Again after three months, I redid the test, but even this time, the result was negative. I was not satisfied, so I went for ELISA test, and again the results came back negative. I consulted two general physicians, who told me that I do not have HIV. But, I am still worried because of the symptoms that I have. I am a male, who weighs 62 kg, and I am 6 feet tall. The symptoms i'm having are:  severe weakness, ulcers in mouth and tongue, fatigue, pain in legs while sleeping, itching in the private part, occasional sore throat, occasional itching and pain in ears, and black spots on my back.  I remember having loose motions after a week of unprotected sex. At that time, the doctor told me that I have food poisoning, and I was alright after taking medicines. Are these HIV tests done by me reliable? Was the loose motion caused due to HIV? Is it possible that my immune system was so weak to detect antibodies during my HIV test? Should I go for another test such as PCR RNA test? Please help me, I am worried. Your kind response will be appreciated. Thank you.","Hi. The test kits used to diagnose HIV are highly sensitive and specific and gives accurate results. The majority of the people who are infected with HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) develop antibodies by three months, and even in the rare instances of late seroconversions, they develop HIV antibodies by six months. You can rely on your HIV screening test results. If there had been no other exposure other than that, you do not require any further test. The symptoms which you mentioned could be due to various reasons and cannot be attributed to HIV. In fact, there are no specific symptoms or signs which can lead to the diagnosis of HIV. As per the above information, you are HIV negative. Just relax. Hope your query is answered, but if you have any other query, please do not hesitate to ask or call anytime. Best wishes.

Most of the persons who are over-possessive of their partner show certain kinds of behavior that is uncommon in the general population. They feel less secure and this sense of insecurity is the driving force for the over-possessive nature. Someone who is insecure may doubt their partner's dedication and may, therefore, try to control them. In short, they feel vulnerable and will do anything to make sure they are not hurt. The sense of insecurity can stem from a number of situations including parents leaving a child, a past romantic partner who was unfaithful and many more.

"Q. As I am having a history of miscarriages, will taking hCG injections help me to continue pregnancy?","Hello doctor, My lmp was on five months ago. I was spotting for three days during my lmp and got a positive strip test after seven days. My beta hCG level on the day of a positive result was 126, and after two days, it was 125. I am being told that I will get periods in two weeks but told to continue folic acid and multivitamin and come for ultrasound in three weeks if no periods come. I have a history of miscarriages, and I am 35 years old. Can hCG injections help me or should I consult another doctor? Have I miscarried or there are still chances?","Hello. Unfortunately what your doctor has said is right. Spotting in early pregnancy is normal. But a fall or no rise beta HCG is a poor sign. Beta hCG is a hormone produced from fetal tissue. At a level of 25 mIU/mL urine test is positive it doubles in 48 hours. So if the result of 7th is 125, then on 9th it should have been around 250 or more. Only healthy fetal tissue can produce an adequate amount of this hormone, so indirectly we get to know the health of the embryo even without seeing it. So it just means the fetal tissue is not growing. There can be lab errors, so to be on a safer side doctor has asked you to come for scan, to confirm.  If you are worried about the repeated miscarriages, have yourself and your partner checked for any problem. Causes like blood sugar levels, thyroid hormone problems, or prolactin hormone abnormalities, any structural problems in the uterus or any problem in semen. Do not lose hope, if you are getting pregnant without much help, no matter what the outcome is, then you will surely have babies. I hope I have clarified your query, do write back if any more questions."

Q. What causes warmness in the left side of chest?,"Hello doctor, I am 23 years old. I am obese and have a family history of cardiac arrest. My father got cardiac arrest at the age of 53.

I am taking Rosufit 10, Nebistar 5 and Cilaheart 10. Currently, I am feeling warmÂ in the left side of my chest for a short span of time. Sometimes, I have slight pain in my left hand and feels like a pinch type of pain in the center of the chest when I inhale and exhale.Â Is it normal?","Hello. This kind of chest pain occurs during stress and anxiety only. We label them nonspecific cardiac chest pain. But, we should always keep in consideration cardiac chest pain and acid reflux. It is important to differentiate between the all. However, the cardiac chest pain is severe and crushing in nature. It increases on activity like walking and exercising. It also gets radiated to left arm. Since your ECG and other cardiac workup are normal, the pain is not due to cardiac issues. For acid reflux, I would advise you to take a combination of Pantoprazole and Domperidone once a day. Your increase in heart rate might be possibly because of anxiety only. For anxiety, try to do meditation and if no relief, you would be treated with anti-anxiety drugs like Etizolam. For further clarifications consult a cardiologist online -->"

I am getting dirty thoughts about her when I think about having love with her.Â I also watch porn especially incest. I want to express my love to her sexually. Please provide some way to overcome this. I am not under any medication. I am just trying to control myself mentally.","Hello. I can understand your problem. Sexual feelings in an adult towards a female are considered as normal and acceptable. But, such feelings towards any female with blood relationship are not acceptable in any society and this result in significant blow to reputation and respect. The feelings you have described towards your own mother are wrong and should be controlled. In future this might result in relationship problem in your case especially towards your wife. This might result in difficulty in maintaining relationship with any other female. To overcome the problem you have to work hard. One thing is that stop watching porn completely. If that is not possible at this moment then watch videos only and avoid going to forums or reading stories of incest online. Such things increase the perversions. Avoid watching any material that relates to incest. I am not saying that you should stop masturbating but stop thinking about incest. You are having guilty after incest ideas, so most likely these are intrusive ideas and should be treated also. If possible visit a psychiatrist for help. Medicines like Paroxetine or Fluoxetine can help to control your intrusive ideas and you will feel better. These are safe medicines. Spend your time in outdoor activities. Gym and sports will help to vent out your energy and you will feel better. Avoid spending more time on computer and if your work permits then stop using computer or internet for some days. This will help you to overcome the addiction. Psychological conflicts. For further information consult a psychiatrist online.--->"
Q. Can Yasmin birth control pill be used as an emergency contraceptive pill?,"Hello doctor, My fiancee and I had unprotected sex a few days back, but I did not ejaculate inside her. Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

Q. My gums behind the last tooth is swollen and painful. Is it due to food impaction?,"Hello doctor, I am an 18 year old, who dislikes visiting the dentist. Therefore, you can imagine my hygiene is very good. I had a brief period of gingivitis as a result of using braces for three years.

My mother predicts a piece of food of some sort got wedged in the gum line, near my tongue. We have tried using Orajel to numb it enough so I could use floss or a toothpick to work around the gum, but it still is very painful to touch and it is very hard to reach thatÂ area. Sadly for me, I am starting my Invisalign treatment and I am going to get the impressions tomorrow. And I also have an appointment for a regular cleaning. I am petrified. Do you think a piece of food is the problem? Is there something I can do to remove the food before my appointment tomorrow? What will the dentist do tomorrow when I ask him to address the situation? What are the chances this is a bigger infection and is not food related, what will the dentist do then? Will I have to have surgery or procedure done or antibiotics will help?",Hi. Regards.

Q. Is talking to myself in front of the mirror a symptom of schizophrenia?,"Hi doctor, I am a 24 year old female.Â I am a healthy and happy person. I eat well and exercise well. I have a lot of friends, cool hobbies, etc. But, I have a weird habit. Whenever I am alone I talk to myself standing in front of the mirror. I imagine a lot. I think so many things like I am in an interview and I try to venture out the best answers and framing smart answers. When I am practicing on my guitar, I imagine lots of people are watching me and appreciating me for playing so well. I imagine futuristic conversations with people where I ask a question and answer them. When I am alone, I keep imagining some stuff. Also, I pick up some topic and start talking to myself in front of the mirror. I personally feel this habit has improved my communication skills, confidence and vocabulary. I am not shy and I do not have stage fear. When I meet my friends or when I am giving presentations at college, I am the one who used to stay very confident. However, some days back, when I was talking to myself in front of the mirror, my mom questioned me. Until now I did not pay much attention to what I was doing. But, ever since my mom saw me doing that I have become conscious. I have stopped talking to myself for two to three days. But, I do not feel like I have been missing out on anything. I am still friendly and confident. But, I am just wondering if I have crossed the line of sanity. I searched about this on the internet and came across something called as schizophrenia. Is this disorder setting with my habit? Do I have schizophrenia or any other disorder? To be honest, after reading about this schizophrenia I am very scared. It sounds like a very serious disorder to me. Please help.","Hi. I read your query with keen interest and understand your concerns. From the available description, I do not think you have crossed the limit of sanity or you developed schizophrenia. Schizophrenia is altogether very different disorder where people have abnormal perceptions such as hearing voices when no one is present and seeing objects when nothing is there. I do not see any of them with you. In my view, you need to put your worries at rest and do what your mind and heart considers right. It may be abnormal for your mother, but there is no pathology with this. If you feel more assistance is required or my answer to your query is far from setting down the worries, then it is better to see a psychiatrist in person.

Q. Why do I have a wet feeling inside the anus?,"Hello doctor, I have a wet feeling inside the anus for the past one year. I did a colonoscopy and sigmoidoscopy, and the doctor said that everything is fine. They said probably the wet feeling is due to sweat.

Q. Is it likely for HIV symptoms to show up after 5 to 6 weeks of possible exposure?,"Hello doctor, I am a 31 year old male, and my query is regarding possible HIV exposure. Four months back, I had a sexual encounter with two female partners. I had insertive vaginal sex and received oral sex. Intercourse had lasted for about five minutes twice with each partner. Condoms were used throughout and were changed for every partner. I do not recall any of the condoms breaking or slipping off completely. About a week or so after the encounter, I experienced some health-related concerns, one after another.I got an eye stye, inside of the eyelid, which was little painful and irritating. It went away in a week. I got a boil, nearly an inch in diameter, in the lower abdomen, which subsided in a week. I also got a white area behind the wisdom tooth. This area was painful during the initial 3 to 4 days, then the pain subsided, and the white area started growing bigger. OPG and clinical examination suggested impacted wisdom tooth and trauma caused by friction of upper and lower wisdom teeth. So, I got both the wisdom teeth extracted. Now, it is normal.I also had a skin tag in the underarm area, which turned painful, hard, and dark purplish. One or two light reddish spots in the adjoining area. They resolved in 7 to 8 days. I have high blood pressure and triglycerides. My triglycerides were 292, which dropped to 195 after 10 days without medication. I got a severe headache one night, which went away next morning. I feel light-headed while walking, staring at the computer, etc., but not when lying down for 5 to 6 days. This happened concurrently with the diagnosis of high triglycerides and BP. I also have diarrhea type condition, that is, I have bowel movements thrice a day, which lasted for 9 to 10 days. My gastroenterologist remarked âno abnormalities detected.â I took antibiotics and other medicines for the dental problem few days before this.I do not have a fever or any unusual skin rash. I do not have unusual body ache or weight loss or loss of appetite. I also do not have any apparent swollen glands. My creatinine and TSH test reports are normal. My LDL is normal, and HDL is little lower than normal. Assuming either of my partners was HIV positive, what is the chance of me contracting his? Does any of the above health concerns related to HIV? Does HIV symptoms, if any, appear together or can appear one after another? What is the most likely period after exposure when symptoms appear, if at all? In other words, is it likely for HIV symptoms to show after 5 to 6 weeks? I realize HIV infection can be confirmed only by a test. However, I sincerely request a prompt and clear response to the above queries, which will help me cut down the fear. Thank you.","Hi.

Q. My period has been late by 13 days. What could be the reason?,"Hello doctor, I am a 24 year old female.Â My period has been late by 13 days.Â I am sexually active.Â I took a home pregnancy test but that was negative. My period has been fairly regular in the past with them happening 4 days prior or after my date.Â I have taken emergency morning after pill in the past (thrice in the last 4 months). What could be the reason?Â Is there a possibility that I could still be pregnant after a negative test, though I have not had any other symptoms of pregnancy nor am I having any sought of discomfort?","Hello. The striking point in your history is that you have taken morning after pill thrice in the last 4 months. It has to be understood that the most common side effect of an emergency contraceptive pill is delaying the next 2-3 menstrual cycles.  As your pregnancy test is negative even after 13 days post period, it clearly indicates that you are not pregnant . Hence, the delay in periods is likely to be due to ipill side effect. Or another possible reason for the delay could be stress induced hormonal imbalance during this menstrual cycle. Stress including emotional, psychological, physical or social disturbances, all have a bearing on the reproductive hormones and can easily delay your menses, once pregnancy is ruled out.  It is suggested that you can wait for another week to allow your menses to resume naturally , if not then you may opt for a withdrawal bleed with progesterone pills to resume your menses.  As pregnancy test is negative, you can rest assured and wait for another week safely. For further queries, consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online -->"

Q. Can I get pregnant with fingering after he touched his penis?,"Hi doctor, I had oral sex, and my partner ejaculated his sperms inside my mouth, and I sipped the sperm that came out. After that he touched his penis, then he grabbed my pants near my vagina twice. After that, he used the same fingers inside my vagina. It was my first time with the oral sex and fingering. I do not know that there were sperms in his hand. We did not have sex. But, can I get pregnant in this situation? I missed my periods this month. What is the cause?","Hi. In your case, there is a chance that semen might have entered into the vagina. As you have not done any sexual intercourse, there is less chance of getting pregnant. You have to rule out pregnancy by urine hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin) test. You can do this test at home. If pregnancy is not present, then thyroid problem and diabetes should be ruled out. Excess stress, obesity, prolonged fasting can also lead to a delayed period. You can consult a gynecologist for examination if needed. For more information consult a family physician online -->"
Q. What is the treatment for inguinal lymphadenopathy?,"Hi doctor, I am a 55 year old male. I am suffering fromÂ inguinal lymphadenopathy. 2 years ago I have this on right side and now on left side. There is a square shallow knot present on the right side now. I have stiffness and rigidity especially in the left arm and occasional limited movements. Also I have discomfort in my legs and inguinal region. On ultrasound it was observedÂ lipomatosis of inguinal lymphs. I haveÂ painful point in inguinal region, only if I press. I haveÂ noticeable weakness, but no weight loss. Occasionally I feel very low energy and could not maintain erection. I feelÂ numbness in the shoulder or finger when wake from sleep. I have low sedimentation rate. There isÂ no abnormal blood and urine finding. I had blood test and it isÂ negative for all infectious diseases such as Lyme, cat scratch, AIDS, etc. Please help with some suggestion. Thank you.","Hi. I assure you not to worry as all things may get settled with proper care and follow-up. 1. Inguinal lymph nodes usually get prominent due to some infection (that you say have been ruled out) or some primary pathology of the nodes themselves.  2. The knots you are talking about also warrants to rule out if that is a vein pathology or lymph nodes can be benign or cancerous changes. Biopsy of the nodes is mandatory especially when there we see changes on ultrasound.  3. Weakness can be due to hemoglobin or red blood cell deficiency. Other causes of weakness may be hypothyroidism or fluid and electrolyte imbalances.  4. Your low sedimentation rate may be due to red blood cell, white blood cell changes and protein abnormality. Sickle cell disease also may cause it. But clinical correlation is the key and for that your physician needs to go for physical examination and if suspicion arises, he may refer you to hematologist.  5. Pain in the lymphatic region can be due to lymph nodes being pressed on or it is possibly from lipomatous changes.  6. I also prefer you to get a detailed heart evaluation from cardiologist as weakness, shoulder and arm issues warrant that too. This kind of symptoms also needs screening for hypertension and diabetes mellitus. Your physician can help you for that too.  7. If you have got tested the above in past 8 weeks, you may upload the reports here for my review and diagnosis. If more than 8 weeks old, please go for repeat fresh tests. Biopsy and histopathology of the lymph nodes. Can be decided on investigations and diagnosis. Revert back with the investigation reports to an internal medicine physician online.--->"
Q. Is it normal to have cobblestone appearance at the back of throat after tonsillectomy?,"Hello doctor, I had tonsillectomy about a month ago. I had been healing but I am concerned about my healing process. My uvula has gotten smaller and has strange color plus I see cobblestone at the back of throat and blue or dark red color surrounding soft palate. And there are visible blue or red blood vessels everywhere around the palate and arch.","Hi. All these are normal after tonsillectomy surgery. I will suggest some steps to relieve some of the symptoms you are facing. Gargles with Benzydamine mouth wash diluted in water few times daily will help soothe the area and relieve pain. You may also take Tylenol for a few days for the pain relief. To relieve inflammation (the engorged blood vessels and cobblestone formation) you can take a combination of Trypsin Chymotrypsin Bromelain Rutopside. This medicine will relieve inflammatory cells and products from the area. Cobblestone formation is normal after the surgery. Regarding the reduced length of the uvula and the scarring on the palate, I would say, they are due to bad surgical technique. We carefully dissect the tonsil out of the pillars so that there is nil scarring of pillars and change to the uvula. We use a coblator for the purpose that minimizes bleeding and postoperative pain."

Q. I had unprotected sex during my infertile days. Can I be pregnant?,"Hi doctor, I am 32 years old female. I had unprotected intercourse 14 days back with no ejaculation from his end.

It has been more than a month; still I have not got my periods.Â Could you suggest some ways to get back my periods? Thank you.","Hi. Please wait for a week for your period to start. If it does not start by then, you will have to do urine pregnancy test to rule out pregnancy. Period could have been delayed due to stress. Another rare possibility is that of pregnancy. Though you mentioned the days you had sex as your infertile days, sometimes occasionally ovulation could be delayed making the days fertile. Still you had taken emergency pill (though it is highly effective in preventing pregnancy, protection offered is not absolute). So, there can be little chance of pregnancy which you need to rule out first. If you want to rule out pregnancy earlier, you can do blood beta-hCG test, negative result of which will rule out pregnancy. Other option as I told is to wait for a week. If pregnancy test comes negative and still period does not start, you can induce period by taking tablet Medroxyprogesterone acetate 10 mg twice daily for five days. Period generally starts within a week of last dose of tablet. It will not induce period if you are pregnant."

Q. I am 13 weeks pregnant. Kindly explain about subseptate uterus.,"Hello doctor, I am 13 weeks pregnant. I have been diagnosed with subseptate uterus with the live fetus in the left horn. Baby is good, with heartbeat and growth. My doctor has advised me proper rest and some medicines. I want to know in detail about this subseptate uterus.","Hello. Let me start with a few basic facts and further clinical correlates and effects. Every lady has two uterine tubes, which fuse at birth, and over time, the wall between the two tubes disappear. Now the uterus is converted into a single cavity uterus. The upper ends of tubes remain separate as two fallopian tubes. Sometimes the fusion is complete, but the partition does not disappear. If the tubes do not touch others or do not fuse at all, then you get bicornuate uterus. But if only the wall is partially removed, it forms subseptate uterus. If the wall does not disappear at all, then the septate uterus is formed. Now in both the last two conditions, the main problem is that the space inside the uterus is compromised. The best option was to have a hysteroscopic resection of septa then get pregnant. Having rest makes no difference. At 14 to 16 the week, she can undergo an elective cervical cerclage. Due to septa, uterus loses its polarity, and she is prone to cervical insufficiency. As space inside the uterus is compromised, she can have preterm pains, preterm labor. Due to septate, the baby presentation may not be head down. I hope I have clarified your query, do write back if any more questions."

What causes respiratory problem in a 36-year-old?,"Hello doctor, My mother is 36 years old, and she is suffering from the respiratory problem from last two days, her hemoglobin count is 9.6, can you please tell what causes this problem?","Hello.

If her Hemoglobin does not improve in one month, get a complete blood profile done to know the cause of anemia. I hope that answers your question.

I would suggest you talk to your orthodontist or general dentist or oral and maxillofacial surgeon to get a final diagnosis after a clinical examination done by them.

Ideally, the emergency contraceptive pill is to be taken within 72 hours of last intercourse to be effective 99 %. It is of no importance if taken after a week. Nevertheless, the bleeding which you got mid cycle before you took the pill was likely to be an ovulation bleed as you had sex in your safe period, then you took the high dose progesterone emergency pill, which initiated a progesterone withdrawal after two days in the form of bleeding as expected. This rules out pregnancy as you had a withdrawal bleed, but it is always best in such cases to get a serum beta hCG test done to be conclusively sure."

He is usually drinking as well. His doctors seem to believe that it is a viral infection and will go away in time. We just started a bland diet for him. Should I be overly worried? He is active and wants to eat and drink. So is this something more serious than we think or am I too worried?","Hello. If there is no blood in stools, it is mostly viral. It usually gets settle in five days. Important here is maintaining hydration. Make sure you give him plenty of fluid, ORS (oral rehydration solution). If he is vomiting, you can ask your doctor to prescribe Ondansetron. Give him probiotics and keep a watch on urine output. If he is passing adequate urine, then there is no point of worry."
Q. Does my skin test indicate tuberculosis?,"Hello doctor, Looking for an opinion on tuberculosis skin test. Please answer if you have experience with PPD skin tests. I am 34 years old, former cigarette smoker. My friend got diagnosed with tuberculosis due to strong arthritis medications, and I have had some contact with him. I have attached images of my skin test below.","Hi. Montoux test, PPD test is a very non-specific test and does not give you any confirmation for tuberculosis. It is used as an adjuvant test for diagnosis and never as sole test. It is read after 48 hours of injection. You have not mentioned the duration. You have to measure its diameter. It should be less then 10 x 10 mm. I cannot measure it online but apparently it is negative for tuberculosis (attachment removed to protect patient identity)."
Q. How can tight foreskin be managed?,"Hello doctor, I am 18 years old, boy and I have a very tight foreskin and I have not even pulled it back. I tried to do it once using oil but it was of no use.","Hello. The mentioned history is suggestive of phimosis in which foreskin cannot be retracted back over glans. Topical steroid cream can be beneficial in mild case. But, in severe case like in your case, if foreskin cannot be retracted, then circumcision like day care minor surgery can be done. So, I suggest you consult Urologist for your examination and operation."

Q. What are the ways to stop sugar addiction?,"Hello doctor, I am having sugar addiction. I always eat candy non-stop and chips and soda, but I am so addicted that I failed the 30-day sugar free challenge in the first three hours itself. I need help, how can I stop this addiction if all my ways are failing everytime I keep trying.","Hello. Sugar is not an illicit drug, but the brain acts in a similar manner to other substance abuse and addictions. Another reason you could be craving sugar regularly is due to how it makes you feel after consuming it. Generally, a sugary treat causes a rush of both glucose and endorphins in your blood. One of the best things you can do to fight your sugar addiction is to start by swapping sweet foods for healthy alternatives like vegetables. Yes, vegetables can be sweet, but the natural sugars you find in carrots, beets, sweet potatoes, and peas are so much lower than what you will find in treats such as gummies, cookies, or donuts. At the same time, theyâ will satisfy your craving for sweetness and you can train yourself to eat these healthier choices over-addictive sugary desserts.  The last small tip for fighting your sugar addiction is to generate a plan for how you will eat. You can write this plan out, post it somewhere, or simply keep a mental note of it, but a plan can help you to succeed in various situations. For example, keep carrot sticks cut up in your fridge so that after work, you can plan to snack on those instead of cookies. Or if you are going out to brunch, decide that your plan is to order an omelet with vegetables so that pancakes (basically, a maple syrup delivery device) is not an option. The idea here is to have a plan for how you will succeed in various scenarios that typically create problems for you."
Q. What causes a soft spot in the middle of forehead in a baby?,"Hello doctor, My daughter has a soft spot in the middle of her forehead for the past nine months but can only be noticed when she raises her eyebrows or if the lighting is right. When sliding a finger over it you cannot feel anything, the forehead feels normal even when she has her eyebrows raised. It looks like a soft slightly raised lump when you can notice it. I have taken her to the doctors but they could not see anything. I had to show them photos as sometimes it really stands out, other times you cannot see it. What should I do?","Hello. Small spot in center of forehead is seen in some pictures (attachment removed to protect patient identity). As you know skull is made up of 16 small bones, these bones are attached with cartilages and get ossified with times. Due to some gaping, this swelling is seen. Give your kid Calcirol sachet once a week for five weeks, dissolve in two spoon water. Syrup Ostebon (Calcium) one teaspoon full twice a day. Feris drops 1 ml once a day. Zincovit drops one ml once a day. Vitanova drops 0.5 ml once a day. All the above for six months."
Q. Is it possible to have infertility due to low progesterone levels?,"Hello doctor, I recently took a women's health test to test my hormones. I just got my results back and my Progesterone level is extremely low where as my Estradiol level is in the normal range. I have dealt with many irregular periods since I was young and have not been able to conceive a child with my husband and now I think I know why. I was wondering if my results can be looked at by a doctor to give me anymore information on what is going on with my test results. I am only 25.","Hello. The reports are fairly normal including the hormonal profile but the progesterone levels (attachment removed to protect patient identity). If these levels are from the proliferative phase then they can be considered normal, however, if from the luteal phase, then they are definitely low. Considering that LH was 11, this test may have been done around day 10 to 14 of your cycle, was it? In cases of progesterone deficiency, one tends to get anovulatory cycles and also shortened cycles with mid cycle bleeds and irregular shedding with often passage of clots, so if not so and if you are experiencing delayed irregular cycles then cause is likely PCOS and not progesterone per se. Also, important in any fertility evaluation is the the male fertility factor. It is important to learn if the semen analysis report of your partner is normal or not, whether the quality and quantity of his sperms are good or not, so please share his semen analysis report as well for review."
Q. My intraocular pressure is getting high in the last six years. Why?,"Hello doctor,Over the past six years or so, my intraocular pressure (both eyes) has risen to 16, to 19, and now to 21. Will it continue to increase still? Kindly help.","Hello. As you might have been informed, increased eye pressure is mainly associated with the disease called glaucoma. This chronic symptomless disease is very drastic to the optic nerve and might lead to irreversible damage, and in the end, cause blindness. However, this eye disease is never diagnosed or established based on eye pressure measurements and requires a detailed and comprehensive examination including many diagnostic tests like, visual fields, gonioscopy, OCT (optical coherence tomography), multiple measurements of eye pressure during at least three consecutive days and these tests might be repeated twice and even thrice in the first year and then every six months if the only suspicion remains. If you have not undergone these tests, please do, and if you require a second opinion, please upload the results of all these tests and I will gladly provide you with my opinion."
Q. What can be done for swollen gums where wisdom tooth is erupting?,"Hello doctor, I think my right side bottom wisdom tooth is coming as there is a ball on the back side of my gum that is really swollen. It almost feels like a pimple and the area around it has white lines on the inner cheek wall. What should I do?","Hello. If there is not much pain, it is better to let it grow fully. It may take a month or two to fully come out. If it does not, and the area gets painful then better to get an X-ray done for its exact position. Use warm salt water gargle twice a day for a week or two. Use a chewing gum on that side, it helps in faster growth of the tooth into occlusion."

Q. Will Kalarchikai cure multiple ovarian cysts in PCOD?,"Hello doctor, I have multiple small cysts in both ovaries (PCOS). Our family friend suggested me to consume Kalarchikai medicine, powdered mixed with pepper and honey to have it for one mandalam (48 days). I have completed nearly 44 days by consuming one small ball of the mixture every morning and before two weeks I got my periods. Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged. Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well.","Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally. Medicine is not of much help."

Q. Kindly have a look on my chest X-ray and explain.,"Hello doctor, I had severe cough and mucus formation which was in yellow. The doctor had prescribed antibiotics, Salbutamol tablet and allergy tablets. Now that cough has reduced but I feel some heaviness at the back right hand side and when waking up in the morning. While I had visited the doctor they had adviced me to take an X-ray. Later they said there is slight pneumonia and to continue antibiotics (Azithromycin) for five days. Also, I have completed my antibiotics dose for four days, still left with one more day. Cough is not there currently and better. I am attaching X-ray that was taken for your advice. Would like to have a second opinion on the X-ray report.","Hello. In attached X-ray report (attachment removed to protect patient identity), there is presence of slight consolidation in right side. So, it is suggestive of pneumonia like infection. For that, you need to complete antibiotic course. If clinically improved well, then no need for further work up."
"Q. Which one should I opt for a vision problem, a laser treatment or specs?","Hello doctor, I would like to know to weather the laser treatment is better than continuing specs for vision. What would be the drawbacks of laser treatment, is it very complicated?","Hello. This is quite a common question youngsters ask. The best answer to this is it depends on you and your daily activities, profession, and lifestyle, etc. For example, if you want to take up professional sports, modeling, enjoy adventure sports, few jobs in the armed forces, getting a surgery done would be quite necessary.  On the other hand, if you want to pursue higher studies and professions where you work a lot with computers and work on fine parts like watchmaking, then surgery would put you at a slight disadvantage as it slightly reduces image quality and increases chances of getting dry eye diseases. Some surgeons also prefer wearing glasses as it protects against infection and blood spurts during operations.  With the latest equipment and techniques, laser refractive surgery is quite safe, and outcomes are good. The risk involved is very less. Although a power of - 5.0 is on the higher side, we can still expect good results given that your corneas are suitable for the surgery.  The main thing to consider is of course long term outcomes are, 1. As a woman, your power will naturally change during pregnancy and lactation, and this happens to all women. Some have more, others less. This is unpredictable. 2. Surgery only corrects you for distance vision. Another natural change in eyes is presbyopia. Here you need to wear reading glasses. So even if you were to get surgery now, you would only remain glasses free for up to around 40 years of age after which you need reading glasses. I hope this answers your doubts. In case you have any further questions please let me know."
Q. What are the tests I have to undergo after having unprotected oral sex?,"Hello doctor,I had an oral sex with a girl without protection, and I licked her vagina too, later I came to know she has PSV which she had undergone treatment and she was cured, I came to know risks of the STD's via oral sex and I was suggested to have test after four weeks, but they did not tell what test I have to go through in detail. My query is, what is the list of a test I have to go through? Please give me the names of the test in detail, so that I can approach a lab for testing.","Hello. There are many tests, but the below mentioned are usually done to rule out the infection. These are a screening test.  1. Test for HIV. Tridot test. 2.Test for gonorrhea (urine or oral swab) and chlamydia. 3. Test for Hepatitis B (HBsAg) and C virus. 4. Test for syphilis such as VDRL (venereal disease research laboratory test) and if required RPR (rapid plasma reagin) test. 5. Test for HPV (human papilloma virus). Herpes virus test is usually not required if no symptoms are present or there is no outbreak of it. I hope this clarifies your concern. Ask again if anything unanswered,"
Q. Is Bimatoprost safe enough for optical nerve damage?,"Hello doctor, My mother, is 76 years old, currently suffering from low, blurry vision (both near sight and far sight). Her BP, sugar, and thyroid are normal. A year before, she was critically suffered from urosepsis with AKI, DM II, pleural effusion, etc. but recovered. Though she has the first stage of renal failure and ventricular ectopic in ECG now. Recently she visited an eye hospital where she was told that her eye problem is mainly due to gradual damage of optical nerve, which is irreversible and the doctor cannot do much. In this respect, she was tested with digital fundus photography and OCT (Retina -Tessellated fundus in the right eye, FR dull in left eye). As per doctor's mention, I come to know that she has some cataract in the right eye (nuclear sclerosis grade II diagnosed in both eye) which need to operate soon for better vision, but I am not sure about it as it is not written in prescription as a diagnosis. She is advised to take a drop of Bimatoprost 0.01 % in both eyes every day to control optical damage. Now, I like to know is this medicine helpful if she complains with optical nerve damage without glaucoma or cataract. Is there any other solution to save her vision or further damage at least.","Hello. I understand your concerns, and I am very sorry to hear about your mother's eye changes. I am afraid that the changes in the optic nerve are indeed irreversible and according to the reports is near total. This is known by the part of the reports that say CDR 0.9 in both eyes. To explain it in a very simple manner, the eye is like a camera, both have lenses, and just like the camera has a film, the eye has the retina. If there is a problem in both the lens and the film, simply changing the lens would not improve the quality of the picture as the film (retina) is also compromised. But in few cases may improve to a limited, yet unknown extent. The problem also gets compounded with her poor general condition with heart problems along with the recent sepsis. So operating on her cataract is quite risky. Regarding the eye drops, Brimonidine eye drops have been known to help in neuroprotection and may help in the preservation of whatever optic nerve function is left, theoretically. So this would be the thought process behind this plan of management given to the overall condition. As far as the next step in managing, it depends on the daily activities of your mother and if at all she feels her current vision is not enough for her to carry out the daily routine activities. In case you need more information, please let me know."
"Q. Other than Sutent, which medicine can I opt for papillary renal cell carcinoma?","Hello doctor,My father is recently diagnosed with papillary renal cell carcinoma type 1, and he has no BP or sugar. However, he had undergone bypass surgery ten years ago. Our doctor has suggested targeted therapy is better for him as there is another mass found in the lungs too. Our doctor has prescribed Sutent 37.5 mg, to begin with, and slowly increase it to 50 mg.However, due to our financial conditions, we cannot afford Sutent as it is pretty expensive for us. As we do not have any insurance. Is this the only drug available for this type of cancer, or do we have any other affordable and similar drugs with minimal side effects? We want to get your suggestion on this. Kindly help.","Hello. As per history given above. Your father as metastatic renal cell carcinoma. I would have liked to have few additional markers like his general condition, report of CBC (complete blood count) and LFT (liver function test), RFT (renal function test) to look at his risk score. In metastatic RCC, in first-line settings we have three TKI (Tyrosine kinase inhibitor) that are approved and commonly used. Namely, Sunitinib, Pazopanib, and Cabozantinib. Sunitinib and pazopanib have almost the same progression-free and survival benefit. Cabozantinib has benefit in progression, but final overall survival was the same as sunitinib. Toxicities are bit different for Pazopanib with more chances of hepatitis, weight loss, and diarrhea. If you are not affording for Sunitinib, then I would say Pazopanib would be better as it is cheaper with similar benefits and slightly different toxicities. Cabozantinib is costlier and not yet available. I hope it helps. I would be happy to help you further if you have any more queries or questions regarding toxicities of these drugs. TKI."
Q. How to hide the gap that will occur due to the wearing of braces?,"Hello doctor,I am going to get braces soon, and I am going to have a large gap, is there anything a dentist could make to hide my gap?","Hello. Braces are placed to align your teeth more esthetically and camouflage the malpositioned teeth. From your question what I have understood is either you have a large gap already, and for that, you do not have to worry, braces will close it, or you are saying that during treatment you are going to have a gap because of the teeth removal. In that case, I want you to know that a few teeth are removed during orthodontic braces treatment to get space for the rest of the teeth to move and align themselves, and ultimately the gap will be closed. So, in both cases, the gap will be minimized or closed. You do not have to worry. Maintain proper oral hygiene, be careful with the brackets, do not break them, follow the advice of the orthodontist and do not miss any follow-ups as these minor steps will help the treatment to finish on time or maybe a little earlier too. Now, if you can elaborate on your question, I can answer more precisely. A picture of the gap will be helpful also."
Q. What is the treatment for a 11-year-old patient with combined type 1 and 2 diabetes?,"Hello doctor, The patient is 11 years old, and right from birth, he is suffering from type 1 and 2 diabetics. Initially, he was on injection and now on tablets every day. As per the doctor, his pancreas is not working from his birth. Can you please let me know if there is any treatment available for this? Also, can the bone marrow blood infusion technique help in treating this issue permanently?","Hello. Yes, there is a procedure called pancreatic transplant. It must be taking place in your place as well. You can click on the individual hospital website and check if they have a pancreatic transplant facility, but it could be very expensive. But let me tell you one thing that even after any transplant, the patient has to take immunosuppressive medications all his life and compared to that the diabetes pills are still a better option."
Q. Is it safe to get a filling fixed while running a low-grade fever from a UTI?,"Hello doctor, Can I get a filling fixed while running a low-grade fever from a UTI?","Hello. Theoretically, yes. But, practically I would not suggest you get it done as you will not be comfortable (mainly because of the water spray from the handpiece or drilling machine) and that will make it difficult for the dentist too. If it is an emergency or you do not have accompanying stuffed nose or difficulty in breathing through the nose, then you can go for filling. Depends on your comfort level and severity of your condition. I hope this has helped."
Q. What should be done when a 5-year-old has a fever of 102Â° with TLC 16700?,"Hello doctor,My son is having a fever of 102Â°. He is 5 years and 4 months old.

Syprup Ondem 5 ml thrice daily 1/2 hour before food, syrup Ibuprofen, paracetamol 7.5 ml 6 hours once after food. We tested his blood, but there was no malaria or typhoid. But his TLC is 16700. He is not taking any food, but sometimes he drinks ORS. So suggest us what to do?","Hello. You are already giving multiple antibiotics and antipyretics. The TLC (total leucocyte count) count in the report is on the higher side, which suggests some bacterial infection. Continue with the advised treatment. Some times fever may take three to four days to respond. Continue to give Ibugesic plus for each episode of fever for now. Cold sponging also helps to bring down the temperature. Get a repeat CBC (complete blood count) and Urine microscopy done. If fever is persisting and not responding to oral medication. The child may require admission for starting IV antibiotics. A complete clinical examination by the pediatrician to find out foci of infection is recommended."

Q. How to find out if my son is suffering from any communication problem?,"Hello doctor, I have twins, a boy and a girl aged 2 years. I noticed that the girl advanced in skills than the boy. In the first few months of life, my son was faster than his sister in the growth and everything. And then, it was reversed. I am a graduate of psychology. I have a brother suffering from autism and frankly, I have a fear of this disease. I do not care and I do not want to surrender to delusions. But, mom and dad insist on reminding me of everything you see them that my son is also the possibility of getting hurt. I started since 10 months; I am watching my son very much. I blame him if he did not implement what I am asking. He says dad and mom. He loves to play, laugh and shake hands if I asked him to do so. He looks into my eyes when I talk, but I do not feel that he understands what I am saying to him always. For example, if I asked him to bring me cheesed off the table,Â he does not focus with me and ignore me. On the other hand, if he feels he is thirsty, then he will come to me and say a bottle of water. I know this is probably because the rate of a normal IQ and concentration varies from one to another child. I want a word from the doctor that makes me serenely scream in the face of all of the notes that my son is not normal and I tell them that my son safe and sound. The question is how completely I know that my son is not suffering from any problems in communicating diseases or behavior?","Hi. I have gone through the query with keen interest and understand your concerns. Before making any opinions I need to inform you that take the things in objective manner and not on emotions I understand there is history of autism in the family and it does not mean your child suffers with autism. In a normal growing child there are many ups and downs and not responding on some occasions is not indicative of serious pathology like autism. We need to take notice that a child plays well with another child, responds to language on most occasions, cheerful, not having any abnormal repetitive stereotyped movements and communicates with the mother. Having said this I feel it will be appropriate to fill a simple questionnaire called Autism Spectrum Screening Questionnaire (ASSQ). This is a screening instrument for autism and you will know probably with sure that whether there is problem or not. If you still feel there is something abnormal, then you may contact the specialist doctor nearby for a physical evaluation. For further information consult a psychologist counsellor online -->"

Q. Will taking antibiotics cause diarrhea or loose stools?,"Hello doctor,I took antibiotics about a month ago, and ever since the fourth day of antibiotic treatment, I have been suffering from diarrhea or loose stools. On the fourth day, I had bad cramps and loose stools that lasted from the fourth day to the seventh day. This then returned afterward with even worse pains, but this time, I had yellow stool followed by diarrhea. Ever since I have been having loose stools on and off that is foul smelling and mushy. Is this because of the antibiotics, or is it an infection?","Hello. Your diarrhea could be a direct side effect of the antibiotic, in which case, it should resolve after stopping the antibiotic. It could also be due to a condition called Clostridium difficile infection (C. diff for short). C. diff is a bacterium typically found in the intestines of most people. But under certain circumstances (frequent exposure to antibiotics), a couple of strains of this bacteria can multiply and produce toxins (called C diff toxin A and B). This can provide diarrhea-sometimes bloody, with crampy abdominal pain. I suggest getting tested for C diff. You need to submit a stool sample for C diff toxin. If it is positive, there are treatments for it includes oral Vancomycin, Fidaxomicin, or Metronidazole. I hope this helps."

Do mouth rinse with lukewarm water and salt or lukewarm water and a bit of mouthwash diluted in the water. But, better to avoid continuous use of mouthwash as this itself can cause dry mouth sometimes, and discoloration of teeth. Get a consultation from a dentist regarding dry mouth, to rule it out. If you have dry mouth, a Sialogogue (to increase salivary flow) will be prescribed by the dentist. Do not worry. You will be fine. If possible, send me a picture of your tongue and teeth."

Q. What can I do to straighten my curved lumbar spine and un-cant hips?,"Hello doctor,I am a 19-year-old male. Around two months back, I had a hiccup when dead-lifting and my lower back or lumbar spine area had a sharp pain. At the time, I did not think much of it and since then discontinued dead-lifts. Over time, I have developed some sciatica in my left hamstring area. I visited a chiropractor about two weeks ago and he took X-rays of my spine, revealing that my lumbar spine is curved to the right, canting my hips and therefore putting pressure on my sciatic nerve. I went in for three adjustments with him, over a one and half week span. I no longer have access to my chiropractor, being that I am overseas. My question is what can I do by myself in order to straighten out my lumbar spine and un-cant my hips so that my sciatic nerve can get some relief? Am I going to have to find another chiropractor and get more adjustments while I am over here? Note that the discomfort of sciatica only happens with a straight left leg when bending at the waist.","Hi. Based on what you wrote, it sounds as though you may have scoliosis, a wedged vertebrae in the lumbar spine, a disc issue, or even lower cross syndrome. If there is any way to attach images of the X-rays, that would be ideal (though I know the current situation is not ideal). Assuming it is indeed a scoliosis curvature, I can tell you that you will not be able to straighten your spine (anatomically speaking). If it is a lower cross syndrome, your best bet while you are overseas is to work on core stabilization exercises. Bridge exercises, planks, and clams may all be beneficial to the lumbopelvic-hip-complex. All of these exercises can be found online, but essentially we want to strengthen the weak muscles and relax the overactive muscle. Please get the help of internet resources to have a knowledge of lower cross syndrome to get an idea of what muscles may be overactive and underactive. Without examining you myself, or seeing X-rays, this is about all of the information I can provide. When you return to your place, I would recommend continuing treatment with your chiropractor.

We used approximately 4 g of ointment in total. She applied some ointment over her inguinal area and me over head of penis and we also had intercourse after that. This happened two times. Would this have caused vaginal absorption of Neomycin and damaged the fetus? Or as it was the month of conception would it have damaged the sperms, egg or the fertilized egg? I read some articles where topical Neomycin has caused ototoxicity, nephrotoxicity and reduced spermatogenesis in males. Should I have terminated the pregnancy earlier? Should I monitor the baby after birth for these toxicities? We did three scans so far dating scan, NT scan and anomaly scan which are normal.","Hello. There are possibilities of absorption per vaginally and I agree there are reports of ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity but as she is six months pregnant now and all scans are normal so there are no morphological anomalies in the child but as far as ear hearing abnormalities are concerned, that cannot be detected by scans. Also, as on date after 20 weeks of gestation, pregnancy cannot be terminated by law unless gross abnormalities are evident in the foetus and permission would have to be sought by high court only."

I had an Ultrasound which showed a few cysts, had mildly elevated testosterone, normal LH and FSH, normal estrogen, low progesterone. My PCP is not convinced. I have PCOS but I am wondering if that is still a possibility and what I should anticipate for treatment in the future (clomid vs. progesterone therapy, etc.)?","Hello. The fact that you are getting positive OPKs each cycle indicates that you have an anovulatory cycle or in simple terms that you are ovulating regularly. PCOD (polycystic ovarian syndrome) cannot be diagnosed alone with just small cysts in ovaries, rather one should have around 10 to 12 multiple small subcenterimetric follicles lining the periphery of the ovary during midcycle scan, one should have featyres of clinical hyperandrogenism like acne, hirsutism (excessive facial and body hair), acanthosis and most importantly oligomenorrhoea or irregular menses. Testosterone alone does not justify the diagnosis. However, if o e needs to be sure, then AMH (ante Mullerian hormone) test can be done, which is more than four indicates PCOD. As mentioned that you are on thyroid medications, I believe your TSH levels are less than five. Please share your ultrasound and hormonal profile reports for review. Now, it would also be essential to check for your partner's semen analysis for quality and quantity of sperms. I am not sure if you have any kids before or not as you have not mentioned, but if you do not yet, then semen analysis of your partner would be mandatory, as your reports are relatively normal. Progesterone deficiency can be treated, and even Clomid can be contemplated only of the male infertility factor has been ruled out first."
"Q. Are tonsil stones, sore throat, and swollen gums symptoms of oral or throat cancer?","Hello doctor, I have tonsil stones, sore throat, swollen gums, and dry cough. Is this the symptoms of oral or throat cancer?","Hello. A recurrent sore throat can occur in a number of pathologies. Most often it is as a result of some local pathology like Rhinosinusitis, nasopharyngitis, tonsillitis, GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease), LPR (laryngopharyngeal reflux). Rather than relapsing and recurring course malignancies tend to have a progressive course. Further age is a crucial factor. Younger people usually do not have malignancies. Your doctor must have checked your throat, and he would for sure have picked something if there was any such thing. GERD and LPR are mainly known to cause recurrent sore throat. Malignancy is the last thing one would suspect at your age."
Q. What are the chances of developing a heart attack in a GAD patient?,"Hello,I am a 28-year-old female. I always worried about her heart. I have GAD specifically focus on health anxiety and often experience heart attack symptoms so much so that I have gone to my doctor and the ER many times (always to be cleared). I continue to worry whenever the symptoms come back. I have been cleared so many times, but still, fear that something could go wrong or something might have been missed. Is there a chance that I could develop a risk of a heart attack without making any major changes?","Hello. A heart attack usually occurs in those with risk factors for ischemic heart disease such as high BP, high sugar, high cholesterol, family history of a heart attack in young age, etc. Your tests are normal thats good. To estimate the lifetime risk of development of atherosclerotic diseases such as stroke and heart attack, have a fasting lipid profile done and send to me."
Q. How to get rid of the rashes which exist even after medications?,"Hello doctor,I have these rashes appearing in my inner thigh and body, and they started small and now has spread across 60 % of my body. I went to my local general physician and was given antibiotics, but that did not help. I was also given Dermol 500 lotion, Betnovate RD cream and Lyclear dermal cream to no avail. It is probably more comfortable if I send you the picture as it is very annoying. It is not painful, but it is spreading to my buttocks, inner thighs near my penis, both arms and body rib. What could it be?","Hello. I understand your concern. I would have appreciated a bit clearer pictures with good light (attachment removed to protect patient identity). The distribution and morphology point towards a superficial fungal infection, which has been modified by topical steroids use? Has it been itchy at any point, any redness? Kindly consult your doctor to discuss the suggestion and take the treatment with consent. 1. Capsule Itraconazole 100 mg twice a day. 2. Tablet Levocetirizine 5 mg once at night. 3. Terbinafine cream apply twice a day. Do this for a week."
Q. Will sharing water bottle cause transmission of genital herpes?,"Hello doctor, My cousin was diagnosed with genital herpes a few days back. She also has a sore throat currently that the doctor thought was strep throat but the strep test was negative. I shared a water bottle with her recently.

Q. I slept for long hours after taking Zyprexa. Is it normal?,"Hi doctor, I take on a daily basic- 100 mg Ixel, 60 mg Paxet, 0.5 mg Clonazapem. My psychiatrist told me to take 5 mg of Zyprexa in cases of SOS. I do not have any psychotic symptoms. He told me it was meant to knock me down, so I could have relief from stress and I could sleep. I took this pill (first time ever) and I slept for 20 hours (I was awake for one hour in between). Then I was awake for three hours feeling really bad, dizzy, spaced out, tired. Then I slept for another nine hours. I still felt bad and restless for a day, but slowly I got less tired and more alert. I guess it is not normal. It was even quite scary. In the meanwhile, should I avoid this pill or maybe reduce it?","Hello. I can understand your problem. You are on high dose of Paroxetine and are also taking Milnacipran, Clonazepam and if even with these medicines the symptoms are persisting, then there is no harm in adding a low dose antipsychotic drug like Olanzapine. Olanzapine in low dose has great efficacy in depressive symptoms, anxiety disorders and in resistant depression symptoms. The drug is associated with excessive sedation and this is the reason you slept for very long duration after taking this drug. In that case one option is to reduce the dose of the drug to 2.5 mg and give this a try. This should help you without causing unnecessary sedation. But, I am not sure if the drug will help much in anxiety if used in SOS basis. The drug should be used regularly after dinner and Clonazepam dose can be skipped which can be kept for use on SOS basis. You can have a talk with your psychiatrist for this."
"Q. I had LASIK done. My vision is all right, but I feel burning sensation in my eyes.","Hi doctor, I had LASIK done for my eyes two months back. My vision is all right but, I feel a burning sensation at the corners of the eyes (corners from where tear comes). After 20 days of LASIK, (back then) whenever I put any eye drops my eyes started burning. Due to the burning sensation, my eyes started watering. I had consulted many doctors, and they prescribed eye drops like Systane Ultra, L-Pred, and Eubri. But no eye drops help me. I do not know what to do. Sometimes I also get redness in the eyes. Is it dryness or something else?","Hi. LASIK when it is done, corneal nerves will be cut. These corneal nerves take several months to regenerate. This can lead to continuous dryness and irritation in the eyes. Eyes also become hypersensitive. Systane ultra is artificial tear eye drops which is a substitute given for this dryness. But, the burning sensation in the corners can be due to an allergic reaction.  L-Pred may help that. Please avoid rubbing your eyes in case of irritation, as it may take a long time for healing the corneal flap; they create in LASIK. Sometimes, eye drops may themselves can cause an allergic reaction to your eye and can cause irritation. You can use different company drops of same content medicine to avoid this problem. Try Levocetirizine tablets. You can a send a picture of your eyes for a detailed evaluation."

Q. Will Kalarchikai cure multiple ovarian cysts in PCOD?,"Hello doctor, I have multiple small cysts in both ovaries (PCOS). Our family friend suggested me to consume Kalarchikai medicine, powdered mixed with pepper and honey to have it for one mandalam (48 days). I have completed nearly 44 days by consuming one small ball of the mixture every morning and before two weeks I got my periods. Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged. Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well.","Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally. Medicine is not of much help."

Q. Got chickenpox during pregnancy. What shall I do now?,"Hi doctor, I am 21 years old. My weight is 48 kg. I am 3 months 2 weeks pregnant. Now, I got chickenpox. I am very anxious about the adverse affect for my baby. I have visited a gynecologist and she suggested me to get abortion. Please clarify me the right step.","Hi. Really this is a confusing state, but this does not mean you have to abort the fetus right now. When mother get infected with chickenpox, fetus carries a risk. But the risk is only 2% and in those cases the fetus might develop rarely some form of abnormality. Thus, straightaway recommendation of termination is not always a choice. Definitely there is no direct answer and it is upto you what to do. If you want to have the risk of 2%, which is very minimal and often equal to an incidence of congenital anomalies in low risk pregnancy, definitely you can continue it. In that case, just go for an anomaly scan from a very good center at the 18th to 19th week to confirm about the integrity of the fetus.

Q. What is the harm of stopping Veltam plus in a person with BPH?,"Hello doctor,My father, 74 years of age, has BPH. He had UTI four years ago and was diagnosed with BPH. PSA was 60 and last three years was on Urimax and past few months on Veltamplus. His PSA is 0.9 prostate size 45 cc and PVR is 70 ml. His symptoms have been the urinary frequency of every two hours all these four years. One doctor has asked to continue the medication. On a recent visit to the second doctor, the new doctor asked to stop the medication. So, I wanted a third opinion. What is the harm if we stop? What is the benefit of continuing it? The medication lowers blood pressure. So, it is down from the 70s to 50s.","Hello. I would suggest you continue medicines as at present his flow (which is good) and postvoid (which is less, it should be less only) are because of medicines. I think if he stops the medicines then his urinary symptoms may get worse or postvoid may also increase. There is no harm in taking medicines. Veltam plus (Tamsulosin and Dutasteride) may cause postural hypotension. If he is suffering from severe postural hypotension then he can stop Veltam plus.  So harms of stopping are: His urinary symptoms may worsen. His postvoid may increase. He may develop UTI (urinary tract infection). Regarding frequency which is every two hours, I think at 74 years it is fine. Just continue as it is. Because apart from prostate there are many age-related changes in the bladder which cause these symptoms and which are inevitable and irreversible. Until and unless very bad frequency like every half an hour then only intervene. Make some lifestyle changes like drink less water at night before bed. Avoid or reduce drinks which cause diuresis like coffee and tea. For more information consult a urologist online -->"

"Q. If my periods are delayed due to pregnancy, can Medroxyprogesterone cause abortion?","Hello doctor, I have PCOS, and I missed my last two periods. Can I take Meprate or Deviry? In case I am pregnant, I want to keep the baby. Will these medicines cause abortion?","Hi. How are you doing? You can definitely take either of the medicines, they both are the same. They are both Medroxyprogesterone acetate, and it is the same hormone which is released from your ovaries in the second half of periods after ovulation. In PCOD (polycystic ovary disease), as you are not ovulating, this hormone will be deficient. So, taking the pill meprate will cause bleeding, only if you are not pregnant. If there is pregnancy, this same progesterone hormone is produced by the ovary to support the fetus. So, these medicines will not cause abortion, but it will support it further. These medicines are very safe whether you are pregnant or not. It can never cause abortion. Hope I have clarified your doubt, do write back. All the best.

Q.

This can be confirmed with a high vaginal swab culture and shall require a course of antibiotics for a week with avoidance of intercourse during treatment. Try using alkaline vaginal washes to clean yourself and avoid chemical soaps. Meet your gynecologist for a local examination and prescription.
Q. Am I having recurrent BV because of unprotected sex?,"Hello doctor,I have recurring BV and I do not know why. I have stopped taking baths, I do not douche, I never use any scented products. I am in a monogamous relationship. I just realized that my fiance washes his penis with shampoo, and we have unprotected sex. Could this be why I cannot seem to get rid of it?","Hi. BV (bacterial vaginosis) is not a sexually transmitted disease. It is just an abnormal change in your normal bacterial flora. I would recommend using tablet Metronidazole 2000 mg once or you can use Clindamycin 5 % vaginal creams once for five days. That is available over the counter. Also, avoid using unnecessary antibiotics. Get your diabetes checked if you are gaining weight. Sometimes, use of probiotics is also helpful in some people.

Take tablet Metronidazole 400 mg three times daily for one week. Take capsule Clotrimazole vaginal pessary at bedtime for a week. Drink plenty of water.Keep your perineal area dry.

Q. What is the skin rash that itch sometimes in a child?,"Hello doctor,My daughter has just started kindergarten three weeks ago and came home today with a rash all over her arms, hands, and feet and one by her lip. She feels fine otherwise but they itch sometimes. Our 7-year-old neighbor just got over strep and impetigo and I am wondering if this could be that. It seems to look similar to the hand, foot, and mouth. She has already missed three days of school for a cold but I do not want to send her if she is contagious.","Hi. I have seen your query and examined your given pictures (attachment removed to protect patient identity). It seems your son has a hand, foot, and mouth disease, and does not look like impetigo. HFMD (hand, foot, and mouth disease) is a viral infection caused by the coxsackie virus. It is a self-limiting disease and takes around 5 to 7 days to subside. Symptomatic treatment can be taken like topical Lactocalamine lotion local application twice daily and Orasep (Chlorhexidine gluconate) mouth gel local application twice for five days after consulting your gp or near by dermatologist,"
Q. Is it possible to treat hydrosalpinx by natural methods?,"Hello doctor,Is hydrosalpinx treatable by natural methods? If possible, what should I do?","Hello. I think you are talking about hydrosalpinx. It is a temporary or permanent blockage of single or both fallopian tube. It is one of the major cause of infertility. It can be managed naturally through ayurvedic medicines and some specific Panchakarma procedure, Uttar Basti of medicated oil like Yavakshara oil. It helps to resolve blockage and open the fallopian tube. There are several causes to such conditions. Some of them are pelvic inflammatory disease, gonorrhoeal infection, etc. Ultrasonography, and hysterosalpingogram. PCOD (polycystic ovary disease), and hypothyroidism. Uttar basti with medicated oil like Yavakshara oil is the safe and successful treatment of hydrosalpinx. Avoid spicy and fried junk foods. Avoid cold drinks soft drinks ice-cream etc. Do regular kapalbhati Mandukasana and Ardha matsyendrasana as well as pranayana like anuloma viloma nadi shodhan and bhramari."
Q. I have diarrhea following constipation for a long time. Why?,"Hi doctor, I am having a slightly upset stomach with bloating for the past four months. I thought I had a bug. Two weeks later, it seemed much better. However, my bowel movements did not return to normal. I had mostly constipation for about a month (even though my stomach did not feel as upset anymore). Then after that month, things flipped and now for the last four weeks at least, I have had movements that are almost diarrhea (very soft, formed only slightly). Colour does not seem abnormal and there is not a bad smell and I do not see oil drops in the toilet bowl. Every morning I have this. I also am having increasing stomach reactions. Every time I put food into my mouth, the gurgling starts. I am not feeling this is a food intolerance as it happens instantly no matter what I eat. I also get a lot of bloating due to the gas. I will, of course, be following up with my doctor, but wanted to ask here. I have a history of breast cancer, so I easily get concerned about cancers (I realize that breast cancer does not often spread to the bowels, but I am still worried about another cancer). I am not a person with a strong history of gastrointestinal upset. I did go through about 7 to 8 weeks of something about seven years ago and never really had a true explanation. Those symptoms accompanied many other symptoms such as nerve pain, twitching, cramping. I felt as though I was having an autoimmune type reaction and am now wondering if it was tied to hormonal changes as my periods changed at the very same time as I had those symptoms (perimenopause). I am currently on Letrozole for hormone positive breast cancer targeted therapy. I had my ovaries out two years ago. So my body is definitely experiencing a massive drop in estrogen over the past two years. I am wondering if you have any thoughts on what this could be? No blood in the stool.","Hi. Your history fits into the acid peptic disease. I do not find any sign of cancer over here (attachment removed to protect patient identity). I would recommend you the following. A combination of Pantoprazole and Domperidone once daily for a few days. A good probiotic, to take a soft and bland diet, to walk after all meals. I would also recommend you to get your thyroid profile checked."
Q. I have acne. Can I use Pantoprazole with Cutein?,"Hello doctor, I have acne for around five years. Now I am using Cutein tablets. I suddenly got a burning sensation in my stomach. So, now I am using Pantoprazole tablets along with Cutein. Is that effective or injurious?","Hi. Cutein tablet contains Iron as one of the ingredients, along with some other vitamins. The iron tablets can give increased acid in the stomach and indigestion. But, if you take both Cutein and Pantoprazole tablets together, the iron will not get absorbed. Therefore, first take Cutein tablet on empty stomach in the morning, and then 30 minutes later take Pantoprazole."

Q. Will Kalarchikai cure multiple ovarian cysts in PCOD?,"Hello doctor, I have multiple small cysts in both ovaries (PCOS). Our family friend suggested me to consume Kalarchikai medicine, powdered mixed with pepper and honey to have it for one mandalam (48 days).

Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged. Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well.","Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally. Medicine is not of much help."

Q. Can a rough foreplay be a cause for a bump inside my vagina?,"Hello doctor,I am a 24-year-old female. I was engaged in some foreplay with someone last weekend. And they fingered me hard. Last night, I noticed a tiny bump on the inside of my vagina. It is a pea-sized right against the wall. It is completely painless, and I would not have even noticed it was there had I not put one of my fingers inside myself.Is it possible that this is just a cyst from the rough foreplay? It feels a bit smaller than it did last night, but I cannot tell. It almost feels like a pimple, But it is on the inside of my vagina, and I can only feel it by pressing my finger against it. What could this be?","Hello.  Yes, probably it is due to injury caused by fingering. And if it is not painful and not causing any discomfort, then you only have to wait until it resolves spontaneously. And the other option is that after a few days say three to four days you can get yourself examined by your local doctor to make sure that there is nothing more than that and this swelling has been resolved entirely. I hope it has helped you should you require any further queries. Please do not hesitate to contact me."
Q. One liter water bottle has fallen on my 5. 5 months old baby. What should I do?,"Hello doctor,My baby was 5.5 months old. One liter water bottle fallen in my baby's head, and that place became reddish. Already she was suffering from fever too. Kindly help.","Hello. Please apply cold water bag to the reddish area. Also, you will need to start the child on drops crocin based on the current weight of the child (is it 2.72 kg? 2.72 kg is too less for a 5.5 months old child). Dose for 2.72 kg is 0.3 ml of drops crocin (100 mg/ml). Also please document the fever with a thermometer. If it is above 100 degrees Fahrenheit, it is advisable to get the child evaluated physically by a pediatrician. Also, if you feel the child is lethargic, has a convulsion or his refusal to feed, it is best to go to the nearest hospital."

Q. A white patch has been formed at the tip of the penis associated with skin tightness. Why?,"Hello doctor, I used to masturbate regularly, and I do not care much for hygiene (I wore the same used underwears, cleaned my penis once in a while, etc.). Now from the last two months, I am unable to retract. The foreskin seems to have become tight and not allowing me to even pull it back a little. There is a kind of white patch formed at the tip of my penis as well. That is concerning. Could you please let me know what might be the issue?","Hello. Let me tell you one thing, you need not worry about your condition, as it is widespread to have phimosis, which is the case with you. The foreskin is tight in your case, and hence, retraction is painful. The white patch you are referring to is nothing but color due to fibrosis. This has nothing to do with masturbation. You can undergo a simple procedure called circumcision, which will get rid of the foreskin and your problem with it, once for all. It is a minor procedure. Please address the issue of hygiene better. Though there will not be any serious health issues with cleanliness, absence of hygiene can result in fungal infection, which can be avoided by addressing the hygiene properly. Let me reassure you again, and you need not worry much, go for circumcision."
Q. Please advice whether I can continue my same dosage of thyroid tablets after the variation of TSH levels.,"Hello doctor, I am under medication for thyroid from past one year. Initially, TSH was 15.5, and I was using 50 mcg later TSH came to 13 so increased dosage to 75 mcg. After which my TSH came to 8.8, and now with same 75 mcg TSH got risen to 11.11. Please advise do I need to continue with the same dosage or increase the dosage.","Hello.  The goal of treatment in hypothyroidism is to normalize TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone) levels. The dose of thyroxine needs to be adjusted until this happens. The dose is weight related to some extent. The approximate dose of thyroid hormone is equal to weight in kg x 1.6. But ultimately, it is the TSH that guides the dosage. Here is what you need to do, 1. Increase the dose of Thyroxine to 100 mcg once a day. 2. Take the tablet on an empty stomach. Do not consume anything except water for one hour after taking Thyroxine. (No tea, coffee, milk, iron or calcium tablets, etc.). 3. Whenever the dose of Thyroxine is adjusted, recheck TSH after six to eight weeks. 4. No diet restrictions for hypothyroidism. Contrary to popular belief, it is fine to eat cabbage, cauliflower, broccoli, soybeans, etc. I hope this helps."

Q. Please guide how to use snehapana at home.,"Hello doctor,I have chronic gastritis. I want to do snehapana at home with pure cow ghee. Can you please guide me?","Hello. Ideally, you should have done it under the supervision of a nearby Ayurveda physician. Because this procedure also requires a close watch and some dietary restriction. Even if you are taking some medicine without guidance, it is not advisable to do it on your own. It can also cause some issues like nausea, vomiting, etc. in some cases, and it might be hard for you to manage it at home. The amount of ghee should be taken on various factors, and it requires a complete history and clinical examination. Also, the amount of ghee needs to be increased day by day for some days. After intake of ghee symptoms need to be watched for proper digestion. If the physician does not find appropriate digestive symptoms, then he can manage accordingly. After proper digestion of ghee, a particular dietary regimen and lifestyle have to be managed. So you should do it under supervision. I hope you understand my point that rather than doing it at home, it is better to do under the supervision of a nearby Ayurveda physician."
Q. Can I use Benzodiazepine for a longer period?,"Hello doctor, I am 29 years old male, with height 5' 10"" and weight 75 kgCurrently, I am on 1. Clonazepam 2 mg one tablet during the night. 2. Trazine-S half tablet during night. I have been suffering from a borderline personality disorder (BPD) along with symptoms of anxiety, panic disorder, extreme irritability, anger, and so on.

There is nothing wrong to take medication for a long time if you are stable on it. Theoretically and ideally, Benzodiazepine should be tapered off within four weeks, but in clinical practice, we have to give it for an extended period, depending upon the patient diseases. If you have no anxiety or sleep disturbance, then you can taper off your way. You can make it half of your tablet for two weeks then take half tablet alternate day for two weeks and then you can stop it."
Q. What could be the cause for heaviness in the head?,"Hello doctor, My husband has been having head heaviness for a month now and I do not know what is causing this. He has had a cervical scan done and other tests were done and he was told there is nothing wrong. It been two months now since this started and is a sudden onset. Prior to this, he used to work out a lot at the gym but not now as he is having numbness and tingling sensation radiation from the lower back down his right leg with severe pains in the morning. There is a moderate pain with movement. He is currently having back pain issues before this head heaviness started. He has had a CT scan done and the report is as follows:  L1-L2 normal findings.   L2-L3 disc bulge with thecal indentation and irrelevant effect.   L3-L4 disc protrusion with caudal migration causing moderate canal stenosis and compression of the L4 nerve root at the lateral recess. Calcification of the disc noted posteriorly.   L4-L5 disc bulge with thecal indentation and contact to the L5 nerve roots at the lateral recess.  Impression: Essentially L3-L4 disc protrusion migration causing moderate canal stenosis and compression of the L4 nerve root at the lateral recess. I want to know what is actually happening. Some advice and recommendation and treatment options available in this situation.  Also, how can we treat the heaviness in the head as is causing difficulty in sleeping?   Are there any medications?   Also, does the head heaviness got anything to do with this situation?","Hello. Your husband's lumbar spine CT (computed tomography)scan is indicative of a disk herniation, which is responsible for the pain in lower back and tingling sensations radiating in the right leg. It is not related to headaches. Considering these CT findings, I would recommend having some rest, avoiding prolonged standing up or sitting position and weightlifting. Physiotherapy and painkillers (Acetaminophen and Ibuprofen) coupled with a muscle relaxant like Flexeril. If the pain persists consulting with a spine surgeon. Regarding headaches, I would like to review his cervical spine CT scan report. It could be related to a wrong posture or a tension-type headache ( related to psychological or physical stress).

Q. What are the abortion options during 6 weeks of pregnancy?,"Hi doctor, I would like to get a summary of abortion options for someone 6 weeks pregnant. Please explain the risk statistics as in what percentage the patient have risks and what type of patients they typically are. The woman in question is an otherwise healthy 21 year old.","Hello. For someone who is 6 weeks or 42 days pregnant as per the ultrasound and the pregnancy has been localized intrauterine, there are actually two options: In medical abortion the patient is given a set of medicines namely Mifepristone and Misoprostol in a set protocol. The aim is to disallow further growth of pregnancy by stopping the cytotrophoblastic invasion into the endometrium (through Mifepristone) and then initiating uterine contractions and placental separation (through Misoprostol). The procedure for drug protocol lasts till max 2000 mcg of Misoprostol has been given in a set protocol till the pregnancy has been aborted. The success rates are 93%-96%, but the disadvantage is that it may lead to prolong bleeding for up to two weeks before all the products of conception can be actually aborted. Sometimes, the bleeding just continues for long and one may have to resort to surgical curettage to remove the remaining decidua in utero. Surgical evacuation is a day care procedure where a suction canal is introduced inside the uterus through the cervix, with patient under anesthesia or a paracervical block and the products of conception are suctioned out completely. If the procedure is ultrasound guided, then the success rates are 100 percent and major advantage is, one can leave for work after 6 hours (till the anesthesia effect passes of if general anesthesia or after 2 hours in case of post paracervical block). The remote chances of Asherman syndrome or intrauterine adhesions have been documented in 1% of women who underwent surgical evacuation where adhesions were formed inside the uterus leading to secondary infertility. But, a controlled, ultrasound guided dilation and curettage under an experienced hand is safe. I would suggest her to opt for medical abortion if the pregnancy is unplanned or accidental as this would be a natural way of aborting and moreover pregnancy being less than 7 weeks, can be easily aborted. A repeat ultrasound pelvis to check for completion of abortion shall be necessary after the procedure is undertaken. The mild bleeding and discharge may or may not continue for long, it depends from woman to woman. If this fails, then of course you have a surgical option to look at. Pregnancy should be completely avoided for the next four months of post procedure as that is the time required by uterus and pelvic organs to return back to their pre-pregnant state."

I am a mother of two kids and do not want there to be an issue.","Hi. I understand your concern as your grandparents passed of a heart attack, the fear you have is genuine. But, just pain in your chest is not an indication of a heart attack. Since you gave a history of carbonated food and tablet Amoxicillin along with thyroid medication, these both can cause an acid reflux and that can cause heartburn and lead to such non-specific pain. However, if the pain was associated with sweating and stabbing character or constricting type with radiation to the left arm, then it is always better to get an ECG done to see if it is related to your heart.

Q. What is the small fleshy growth in my anus?,"Hello doctor, I am a 19 year old female with no past medical history. I experienced constipation for some days, and I saw blood in my stools. I found this small fleshy growth on the anus, which hurts after passing motion. The pain ceases after a few hours. This fleshy growthÂ retracts inside when I contract the surrounding muscles, but it comes out when I relax. It does not cause any pain during other times. I am attaching a picture of this fleshy growth. Please help.","Hi. I have seen your attached picture (attachment removed to protect patient identity). It shows old hemorrhoids called as skin tags. This picture, along with the pain that you are describing is suggestive of anal fissure. This is a tear in the wall of the anus, at the base of these skin tags. Here is what you need to do: To heal the fissure, do sitz bath. Take lukewarm water in a medium sized tub, put two teaspoons of ordinary salt per liter of water. Total 10 g salt per liter of water. Now sit in this water and try to push out on the anus. Try to make the water clean and sooth your anal region. Sit for around 15 minutes, 3 to 4 times every day for a month or so. Try to do this at least twice per day if you are working professional. It will decrease pain, itching, and help to heal the fissure. Do these for around 6 to 8 weeks. For pain relief during passing stools as well as healing of the fissure, I suggest the following or equivalent generic combinations for at least three weeks, after that only sitz bath should be enough: For constipation, I suggest you try the following: Curing constipation treats these and also prevents these from troubling again.

Q. Can long-time earphone usage cause pain in ears?,"Hi doctor, Yesterday I used earphones which fit directly into ears for a very long-time. Today I am having extreme unbearable pain in back of head and ears. I have stopped using earphones now. Is there a fast fix for this unbearable back head pain? Can I take Disprin (I never take painkillers)? I use earphones on a daily basis under the prescribed volume limits. Though I have little pain sometime but not to this extent. Please suggest any medication.","Hi. My understanding and inference is that the pain is not related to the earphones or sound level. This is because of loud noise which usually produces classical symptoms like giddiness, ringing sound in ear, hearing loss, intolerance to loud sounds and some pain in ear. Your symptoms are not very classical to diagnose. Please answer below questions for clear diagnosis. With the details available as of now, I infer that the pain is muscular most probably. For the same, I suggest you the following measures. To understand any occurrence of sound trauma to your ears we must do a pure tone audiometry. This is the definitive investigation to understand any damage to inner ear due to sound. I feel a strong pain killer like Aspirin is not required for these complaints. However, there is no reason to worry as of now. Muscle ache. Bad posture. Rigorous exercise. Pure tone audiometry (this investigation is usually present in speech centers and otolaryngology clinics).

Q. What are the possible causes for heart trembling?,"Hello doctor, I am 56 years old.Â I have a feeling of trembling at heart since a month. Sometimes, I feel this trembling even while sleeping and hence, the sleep gets disturbed. During daytime, I also get uneasiness and shivering for hours after an episode of heart trembling.Â My BP after this feeling was aÂ little bit high at 180/85 mmHg and then it came down to 135/85 mmHg.Â I went to aÂ neurologist and took CT scan and Doppler of the neck to find for any blocks.Â Both the scans were normal. The doctorÂ prescribed Rancil, a beta blocker 50 mg, Aspirin, sleeping pill 0.25 mg and Vertin.Â I hear some sounds in ears. I also had ear pain and giddiness due to ear fluid. The doctor told that such trembling feeling may be due to ear fluid imbalance or may be due to little blocks in blood vessels, which may not be seen in the CT scan. After I took the medicine for six to seven days, there was no such feeling. For the last three days, I stopped medicine, which was prescribed for 15 days.Â Yesterday night, I felt the same trembling at heart and the sleep was disturbed.Â Then, I took only beta blocker 25 mg (half of the original prescription), Aspirin and sleep pill and I had a good sleep.Â I am not a diabetic and have no BP so far. TheÂ BP in the last three to four days was normal at 125/80 mmHg even thoughÂ I did not take the medicines.Â I walk for one hour on a daily basis regularly. I am also experiencing fainting like feeling, lack of concentration, losing of a sharp and normal vision sometimes. It takes about two to three hours to recover from these symptoms. WhenÂ I take aÂ beta blocker, AspirinÂ andÂ sleep pills I find myself feeling better, but the BP gets lowered to about 95/60 mmHg. For the last two decades, I had vertigo. I used to get it once in every 12 to 15 months and IÂ had got used to it. It normally go away in 15 to 20 days.Â But this time, in the last one month I doubt this is vertigo though I hear some ear sounds and have aÂ little pain in the ears. Though I drive car and two-wheeler slowly, the feeling and unsteadiness makes me very uneasy. During night, sometimes I suddenly wake up after some vibration from the stomach and the chest portion and hence, sleep will be disturbed. I experienced trembling, three times in one month during daytime and felt uneasy in the hands and legs for five hours after that. In the morning, unsteadiness starts to occur and it has happened five times in one month. I am not able to concentrate and there is a fearful sensationÂ in the body. This problem needs to be treated. I doubt whether taking Metoprolol and Rancil will lower the blood pressure. For the past 10 days, I am taking Metoprolol 50 mg, RancilÂ 20 mg at night, Aspirin at night, Vertin at night, sleep pill 0.25 mg at night and Pan 40 in the morning. Earlier, I was taking Vertin.

Q. Will Kalarchikai cure multiple ovarian cysts in PCOD?,"Hello doctor, I have multiple small cysts in both ovaries (PCOS). Our family friend suggested me to consume Kalarchikai medicine, powdered mixed with pepper and honey to have it for one mandalam (48 days). I have completed nearly 44 days by consuming one small ball of the mixture every morning and before two weeks I got my periods. Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged. Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well.","Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally. Medicine is not of much help."
Q. I am getting pain in penis and tingling sensation in testicles. Please help.,"Hi doctor, I am a 27 year old sexually active male. I have been with the same girl for the past 10 years and we are loyal in the relationship. I am having a ton of issues and pain in my lower region. The symptoms are lower back pain, pain in my pubic region, pain and tingling in my testicles, burning with and without urination and pain within the penis.Â I have been to three different walk-in clinics and had three different antibiotics, including Levaquin, Bactrim and Cipro. I went to a urologist and was told to have pelvic pain syndrome. I have had similar issues in the past. I dealt with a prostate infection a few years ago and that was treated with antibiotics. But, this time nothing is working. Most urine cultures show no bacteria. My thoughts are possibly pudendal neuralgia or interstitial cystitis, as my mom has IC. Do you advise sonogram or endoscopy or medications?","Hi. Your symptoms do point towards chronic prostatitis. With negative culture and positive pus cells, it is likely that you are suffering from CPPS IIIA, which is non-bacterial inflammatory chronic prostatitis. Now, this is a difficult condition to manage and requires long-term therapy. I would suggest that you follow up with a urologist on a long term basis. Therapy takes some time and different medications work for different patients. IC (interstitial cystitis- painful bladder) is also a possible condition, but CPPS is more common in males than IC. You do not meet all criteria for IC as per the classic definitions. So, I would keep CPPS as the first differential. I am mentioning some tests that you may want to get done to clarify the situation in a better way. Recurrent infections. Urine anti-proliferative factor, EPS Culture (expressed prostatic secretions) after prostatic massage, uroflowmetry with post-void residual urine assessment and cystoscopy. 1. CPPS IIIA. 2. BPS (bladder pain syndrome) / IC. I suggest combination of Amitriptyline, alpha blockers, NSAIDS (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) and Gabapentin. Dietary modifications will be necessary. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and take the medicine with consent. Stay away from spices, coffee and anything that you feel trigger the symptoms or aggravate them.

Q. I feel numbness in penis. Is it due to nerve impingement?,"Hello doctor, I am a 26 year old male. My height is 190 cm and weight is 85 kg. I do exercise with weights regularly.Â I have noticed that I have reduced feeling in the skin on my shaft. I cannot feel normal touch, but I can feel the pain if I pinch it with my nails. To best describe it; it feels like my penis is not there when the head was covered by foreskin. I just noticed it two weeks ago. Is this due to nerve impingement? I do not have any back pain or radiating pain down the legs. There is no trouble or pain with defecation or urinating. There is no tingling or pins and needles on the shaft. Rarely, I feel some burning or numbness feeling. I do not notice any discoloration or anatomical abnormalities. Is this a sign of diabetes? But, there are no symptoms such asÂ polydipsia, polyuria, etc. I do not remember anyÂ trauma to the penis.Â I do not ride bicycles at all. I have been to a urologist and done an ultrasound of the penis and testicles along with a Doppler. But, there is no finding to be worried.My libido is very low. I get erections during the night or if I really concentrate on erotic thoughts. I have not tested testosterone levels, but I suspect them to be normal. I do not really mind the reduced feeling in the shaft. But, it would be nice to get it back. I am worried by thinking that it may spread or this is a start of a more serious disease.Â What is your opinion?Â Thanks in advance.","Hi. This is a localized numbness that we are bothered with. Disease starting from this region without any other associated symptoms is quite rare and without them we may not think of a systemic pathology right away. Have you tried nerve tonics? I suggest back strengthening exercises and Pregabalin 75 mg once a day for two weeks. Vitamin B12 levels and HbA1c should be helpful. Consult a specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and take the medicine with consent. Lack of erections may suggest a more systemic disease, but we need to have more a detailed talk before we can attribute symptoms. For further information consult a urologist online -->"

Q. Which ayurvedic medicine can give a long time relief from asthma?,"Hello doctor, Thank you for giving us the first query free. I am 26 years old male suffering from asthma for the past 14 to 15 years. So, I feel shame for myself when I use an inhaler. I am not able to go on tour especially in winter because I do not want to share my worst condition in front of my known people. I do not need any sympathy faces. Sometimes, I do not feel shortness of breath but wheezing irritates me, and I am unable to focus on work. When people leave me alone, then I take inhaler. When I take a bath in winter, I feel shortness of breath. Right now I am taking Bresol (Himalaya tablet) two times a day for past two months with lukewarm water. This winter I am drinking lukewarm water every time. But the problem is still there. When I go to sleep, I feel wheezing and the same when I wake up. A pharmacist said to use Septilin (syrup) with Bresol and take Bresol thrice a day and Septilin twice, and nobody told me how long I have to take this. I know asthma is not curable. Please give me some good advice and names of medicines (ayurvedic) for long time relief. And also advise regarding Bresol and Septilin (especially how long I have to take this).","Hello. Regarding the continuation of medicines, you may have to use the multivitamin tablet, Septilin (Tinospora) and Bresol (Turmeric, Vasaka, and Vaividang) for a long time till your allergic condition persists. These medicines are for helping your body develop good immunity against the respiratory problems. These medicines act slightly different than inhalers. Although, I would like to tell you that inhalers are scientific. Ayurvedic medicines may not help to get respite from an acute problem. Asthma is a manifestation of hypersensitivity. It is wise to find the cause of the hypersensitivity. We call the same allergy. Rhinitis asthma is different manifestations of allergy. Allergy is present in the genes, and we may not be able to cure allergy entirely. Allergen avoidance forms the mainstay of the treatment and management of allergy. You should be carefully noting down which areas and circumstances lead to the symptoms in you. Like going to gardens, smoking, pollution, dust, particular smells and fragrances, fumes, effluents, climate, etc. You should also note when the symptoms are more and when they are less. Whether there are any seasonal or diurnal variations. Once you have a detailed diary regarding this, you will be able to make some reasonable conclusions regarding when you have to be careful. Next method of finding out the allergen is allergy testing. The two methods available are skin prick testing and blood immunoCAP method. Both methods are easy and fast, but skin prick testing is more accurate. Once we find out the allergens causing the problem for you, we can give you specific advice on how to avoid these allergens and stay safe. The treatment of Septilin and Bresol that you are taking are to help your body stay healthy, improve immunity, provide all nutrients and micronutrient for the body to deal with offending agents. But these are not the definitive cure for the problem. Hence, it is not possible to say clearly till what time you will have to take the medicines. Additionally, if you get an asthma attack during the course of these medicines, you may still need inhalers or nebulization or medicines on an SOS basis. Do share with us your prescriptions and investigations reports so that we can help you better. Hope to see you healthy soon. For more information consult an allergy specialist online -->"
Q. I have pink rash on the side of my nose that gets worsened in sunlight. What could it be?,"Hello doctor, I have had a red/pink rash on the side of my nose for about a year and a half now.

I used to take allergy pills every day for about two years and then I noticed the rash, so I stopped pretty much completely for about a month. It seemed to get worse and again I started taking them for another 3 months probably. It had no effect on the rash and I stopped completely and I have not taken a pill for almost three months.Â Does this sound like a reaction to the pill or is it something else?

Q. What treatment will help for discolored skin and red circles in inner thigh?,"Hello doctor, I am a 49 year old fairly healthy male. My height is 6 feet and weight is 260. I am overweight and also have low testosterone. I have had a noticeable shrinkage in my testicles in recent years. I have embarrassing erectile issues, including premature ejaculation and often I am unable to maintain an erection. I am not on any regular medication. I do not drink alcohol or smoke. I have attached my photos for your reference. My skin is discolored with red circles on my inner side of the legs up to each side of the scrotum. It frequently itches especially after much walking. The red circles are also present just above my penis, but are obscured by my pubic hair. I am also concerned about a patch of darker skin on my scrotum. There is also a pimple or a tag of skin on my inner right leg; two smaller ones on the inner left leg and one at the top of my right leg where my pubic hair stops. They all sometimes hurt, especially when my innerwear rub against them. I have had these for years. I was in the hope that they would go away on their own, but now I have noticed a few small ones begins to develop in the same area. There is also a mole or pimple like growth between the base of my scrotum and anus. This hurts or itches when I sit or walk too long. I have not sought treatment to care of these issues before because of embarrassment. What treatment or medication might help? What do you suggest?","Hello. At the onset I would like to tell you that though I understand your concern and situation, but there is nothing to be ashamed or apprehensive of yourself. It is a medical problem and can only be tackled by proper medical treatment and advice, and not by hiding your problem from doctors. It is great that you do not smoke as it may increase your problem. According to your weight and height your BMI is 35, which falls in borderline to moderately to severely obese. I advise you to visit or ask an endocrinologist regarding the shrinking of the testicles and erectile issues as these may be related to hormonal balance or even obesity. Red circles on the inner thighs (attachment removed to protect patient identity) are indicative of fungal infection known as tinea cruris. For this, a course of antifungals is advised. I would suggest the following treatment. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and take the medicine with consent. The outgrowths of skin are skin tags and they are usually related to hyperlipidemia. They are not harmful and only have cosmetic concerns. They are best dealt with by simple office based surgery with cautery machine requiring only local anesthesia, which is a 5 minute superficial procedure. But, they will not go on their own. You may get your fasting serum lipid profile done, which will measure the levels of cholesterol, LDL (low-density lipoprotein), VLDL (very low density lipoprotein) and HDL (high-density lipoprotein). If any of these are abnormal suitable, then medicine can be started. Medicine is important as abnormal lipid profile increases one's risk of cardiac events in the future. One important thing on which I cannot emphasize enough would be decreasing your weight. If you can gradually decrease your weight even by a few pounds, you would see a lot of these medical problems would get better by themselves. You may follow up after two to three weeks.

Q. I am hearing a strange noise only at night. Please help.,"Hi doctor, Around three months back, I started to hear a strange noise at night. We live in a village. Apart from the odd barking dog and passing car, it is silent, especially at night. However, I started to hear what sounded like a distant engine, but it never got any closer. It is almost like a droning sound, not a hum as such as seemed to almost vibrating through me. It did not particularly stop me sleeping, but was annoying. It was there for a couple of nights and I would go outside and could not hear it. I could hear it in other rooms of the house, although maybe not as loud as the bedroom. I could find no real explanation for it. Electric cables are going to the house but have been the same for years, and nothing has changed. Then a couple of weeks later, the noise was back and was really loud when I went to bed. I fell asleep but woke in the middle of the night, and it kept me awake. The next day I could still hear it everywhere in the house, also in the next door house, but not so much outside. It is like a constant distant aircraft noise or car engine that goes in and out, louder, quieter, louder, quieter and at times I almost feel it than hear it. It left me tired with a slight headache, and it was just pulsating through my body all the time. That was the worst day. Since then we moved to another house in an entirely different area, although still a quiet village location. There is a very little passing traffic as we are at the end of a lane. At first the noise seemed to have gone;Â however, I have begun to notice it again. I can hear it all the time, but in the day there are other noises and distractions. It is at night when it is very quiet I can hear a constant drone. It now seems mainly in my left ear, or I can hear it especially in that ear. If I put my finger in that ear, it stops. Also if I hold my nose and blow and keep the pressure up the noise cannot be heard. If I put my finger in my right ear, I can still hear it, although maybe not as loudly. For example, it was very distant this morning. If I put my left ear on the pillow and lie on my side, I can hear it just the same. It does not keep me awake and or cause me any real problems. I am just getting concerned it could be due to something nasty, like a brain tumour or something. I went to the pharmacist and got some cleaning spray. I have also had a consultation with an ENT specialist. I did not explain to him about the droning sound as it is difficult in another language, but he gave me a checkup and did not find anything out of the ordinary by looking in my ears, nose, throat, etc. I have recently been diagnosed with hypothyroidism although I can get no connection. If it is tinnitus, then I can live with it quickly enough at the moment. But, I am concerned that it could be the symptom of any serious underlying problem. I have had recent blood tests done, and they were all fine apart from my TSH levels for hypothyroidism, and my blood pressure is fine.",Hi.

I want to become fair as my marriage is going to get fixed by next year. Please suggest me some creams, so that it should not show any side effects. Also, how long I should use it? If I use anything, then will it have any effect in case of pregnancy, etc? Please help me. Thanks in advance.","Hi. One's skin color has 2 components. First one is genetic, which cannot be changed. Every skin color is beautiful in its own way and we should learn to love our skin color and augment it and not hide or lighten it. The second component is acquired, which is due to the influence of environment, sunlight, hormones, aging, etc. We can only target the acquired component of fair skin color while attempting lightening procedures. I suggest you antioxidant capsules like capsule Antoxid HC (Beta-carotene) and apply sunscreen lotion Lashield gel at 8 AM and 12 PM. Also, you can apply Glyaha koj lotion (Hydroquinone) at night time. Start with an alternate night application initialy as it may irritate your skin a bit and after a week or so, shift to daily night application. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and take the treatment with consent. You can go for chemical peeling or microdermabrasion from your dermatologist which will help in exfoliating and give you a clearer skin tone. All these treatments are free of side effects. You may use them for three months. For further information consult a dermatologist online -->"
Q. There is a thin black line on my finger nail. Is it skin cancer or melanoma?,"Hello doctor, I am a 25 year old female. Two years back I had noticed a very thin black straight line on my nail in the right hand finger. This line is growing along as my nail grows. Though the line was thin initially, now it has increased in its width and thickness.Â When I searched in the net about the straight black line on my right hand forefinger, it is showing up as something related to skin cancer or melanoma. I am worried. Should I be concerned about this? I am not very dark, nor very fair. I have wheatish skin. Please advice me. I am attaching a snap of my finger with dark line for your reference. Also, I used to have three moles on my left hand which had been there since my childhood, but to my surprise two years back they went off easily. I got another very small new mole at a different place on the same hand and that too went away when I scratched it off. Is this something normal?","Hi. I can understand your concern. I have gone through the attached picture (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Presence of linear pigmented lines on the nails can be due to multiple causes. In white people they are considered abnormal and require thorough assessment including biopsy. In dark skinned people it is a common variant. The most common cause of these lines is racial factors. Others being drugs, trauma, lichen planus, subungual nevi and malignant melanoma. You do not have to worry too much, but do keep a watch on the pigmentation. If you notice any variation within the pigmented line or pigmentation on the adjacent nail fold or finger pulp, then consult a dermatologist in person and get yourself evaluated. Regarding moles at other sites, it is sometimes possible that they can disappear. So you do not have to worry about that. For further queries, consult a dermatologist online -->"

Q. Will Kalarchikai cure multiple ovarian cysts in PCOD?,"Hello doctor, I have multiple small cysts in both ovaries (PCOS). Our family friend suggested me to consume Kalarchikai medicine, powdered mixed with pepper and honey to have it for one mandalam (48 days). I have completed nearly 44 days by consuming one small ball of the mixture every morning and before two weeks I got my periods. Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged. Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well.","Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally. Medicine is not of much help."

So came to know that I have mild umbilical hernia 0.7. If I do proper exercise and follow ayurvedic medicine suggested by you, then is this mild hernia curable? Please help me with this. Also, can I climb stairs in mild hernia?","Hello. I understand your concern. Since you had C-section, you are likely to develop incisional hernia which is a common issue faced post C-sections if proper care is not taken during wound healing. It is not curable with only medicines but it can be preventable from reaching further stages. If you find and center close by which practices post partum care in Ayurveda then get the following done.

Q. I am getting recurrent left eye pain with worsening eyesight. What is the problem?,"Hi doctor, I am 19 years old. I have pain in the corner of my left eye for the past one year. I went to the doctor, and he gave me Sterdex. I used it and felt better. My pain went away. After a few months, I started to have pain, but it was not so severe as the first time. I wear glasses and lenses, and I am treating my eye allergy with Chibro Cadron 5 ml, and for dry eyes, I use Fluidabak after taking the lens. Whenever I do my yearly eye checkup, my eyesight gets worse because of the pain in the corner, and I am scared about my sight. I do not know whether I use an appropriate medicine to my eye. Whenever I consult the doctor, he gives me the same medication. Please help me.","Hi. Minimize the use of steroids as much as possible to avoid side effects such as an increase in eye pressure leading to glaucoma. Both Sterdex (Dexamethasone) and Chibro are steroids. They may relieve your symptoms in the short run but may harm your eyes if used for long term. Pain in the corner should not affect your eyesight. Just use appropriate glasses. For lubricant, you can start with Carboxymethylcellulose containing drops, and it can be changed later if more lubrication is needed. For allergies, Olopatadine containing drops can be used. Keep in touch with your doctor."
Q. What is the reason for decrease in the visual field even after having medicines for glaucoma?,"Hello doctor, I am a 60-year-old female, who weighs 198 lb and 5.7 height. I was diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer 20 years ago. I am suffering from chemical depression due to chemotherapy, and so, I am on antidepressants for 20 years and on Celexa for the past three years with good results. Before five years, I was diagnosed with 90 % optic nerve damage in the right eye and 75 % damage in the left eye due to open-angle glaucoma. I am under Brimonidine Tartrate and Dorzolamide twice daily and Latanoprost once daily for the past five years with good control of glaucoma and proper visual fields. The recent visual field test showed a decrease in the visual field. Laser treatment was done again for open-angle glaucoma before a week.","Hello. I am sorry to hear about what you are going through and wish all the health in the world. Fortunately, Celexa (Citalopram) is not significantly correlated with glaucoma as a side effect, and I doubt that the progression of your disease is related to your intake of the antidepressant. Glaucoma is a chronic disease that tends to progress regardless of all actions taken by the ophthalmologist slowly. Our main approach towards glaucoma is to keep it under control because we are not able to treat it and based on your history of ophthalmic care you seem to be in good hands, but you should be very punctual on your follow-up and doctor's recommendations. You can also add artificial tears four times daily at least to that list of eye drops that you are using. Dry eye is inevitable with all the medications that you are using."

There is some irritation in eyes and vision is hampered in one eye. I wanted to get an opinion on how serious. What should be done? Do we need to take urgent action? Can we cure it completely?","Hi. The thing with glaucoma is that it is a progressive condition and we can arrest its progress to a level that it does not cause further damage. The vision loss that has already been done by the disease is not reversible. Our goal here is to lower the pressure to such a level so that it does not cause further damage.

Q. Can minimally invasive glaucoma surgery be done in sensitive eyes with glaucoma?,"Hello doctor, My mom is a glaucoma patient for the last 10 years. She has been on medications like eye drops including Azopt, Ganfort, Alphagan, Vigamox, and prior to them Cosopt (which did not suit her). She has gone through retina eye laser and also has been injected in both her eyes almost 22 times for retinal leakage as well, has also gone through cataract eye surgery 16 years ago. At the moment her eye pressure remains between 21 to 24. The doctor says implants are necessary as she can see very less now. Given her eye condition is sensitive, a doctor has suggested that it is best to operate her with Ahmed valve implant, however, it has its own risks. I wanted to know if it is better to try the latest option, called MIGS (minimally invasive glaucoma surgery) like Xen Gel Stent and InnFocus Microshunt as it has near to no complications. I want to get an opinion about this before thinking about Ahmed valve.","Hello. I am very sorry to hear about your mother's eyes. I suspect that she must have undergone the retina laser and the injections for a condition called as diabetic retinopathy. I feel that most likely it is a complication of diabetic retinopathy that might have caused a high pressure in her eyes. Xen gel stent is currently FDA approved for refractory glaucoma not caused by diabetic neovascularization and Inn focus micro shunt is currently being tested for long term side effects and usefulness in such situations. I must be clear in letting you know that neovascular glaucoma is a very adamant disease to treat and the treatment may not be straightforward and may require multiple procedures and reviews with the treating doctor, yet the most often agreed upon surgery, across most hospitals in the world is currently Ahmed glaucoma valve, along with of course the laser and injections. In case you need further clarification or if your mother is not a diabetic, please send a scanned copy of all her doctors records and prescriptions. I will do my best in helping you understand the situation."
Q. Are Formonide and Pantacid enough for asthma and GERD?,"Hello doctor, I am suffering from asthma since last three years. I am using Formonide 200 two puffs two times daily. I am also suffering from GERD for the past seven years. Now I only take Pantacid 40 as and when required. It is my question. Is it a perfect prescription for me?","Hello. A Formamide inhaler is a good medicine for asthma. Is that dose right for you or not depends on your level of asthma control? If it is well controlled, it can be continued. However, if over the last three months of your symptoms were well controlled may be able to attend come down with the inhaler dose. I would suggest you be in touch with your pulmonologist for this. If your GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease) symptoms are only occasional taking Pantacid as and when needed shall suffice."
Q. I am taking Foracort for asthma. Will it give complete cure?,"Hi doctor, I am 21 years old now. I am suffering from asthma for more than 17 years. It was horrible until my 15 years of age.

I am taking Foracort 400 Rotacap during breathlessness. I am taking the tablet for the past four to five years.","Hi. Having night symptoms mean that your asthma is not well controlled and upgrading the treatment is required. Foracort Inhaler 400 mg is a right combination that is used daily. I recommend you take Singulair 4 mg tablet (Montelukast) once daily in the evening. Use blue inhaler during the time of exacerbation every five minutes till 20 minutes. If there is no improvement, you should visit the nearest ER (emergency). Also, let me know if you have a PEFR (peak expiratory flow rate) chart."
Q. Kindly mention about the foods to be avoided in an asthma patient.,"Hello doctor, What are the foods items that should be not given to the asthma patient?","Hello. As you said correctly that asthma patients should always take care of their diets as some food ingredients may cause a severe asthma attack. Grossly we cannot avoid all food types because there is person to person variability to the food allergy. So you should strictly avoid food that is causing some difficulty in breathing or attack. To find out exactly we can do skin prick allergy test or blood allergy test so that you definitely know what food you are allergic to. After that, you must avoid those food items. Processed foods, some bakery items containing eggs, chilled drinks, food colorants, should be strictly avoided. Always check ready-made foods or processed foods for ingredients. Sometimes butter, cheese, yogurt, and milk also needs to be avoided in some cases of diagnosed allergy. Otherwise, you can enjoy fresh fruits and vegetables in your diet."

Q. Can allergic asthma turn into permanent asthma?,"Hello doctor,I am 29 years old now. I have allergic asthma for last 6 to 7 years but in very mild form (mild suffocation and coughing for 2 to 3 days, once in three months). It used to get triggered by an old house (old book or newspaper dust) or distemper and paints or orange flavored drinks. But since last one month, frequency and magnitude both have increased. Yesterday, for no possible reason known to me, it got triggered. My query is can such allergic asthma turn into permanent asthma? I want to avoid any long-term course until extremely important. What is my option to tackle or control and reduce above symptoms, with mostly home remedies, diet control exercise and minimum synthetic medicines? Nose bleeding in childhood, frequent nasal blockage till the age of 21.","Hi. As per your symptoms, you are suffering from bronchial asthma with allergic rhinitis, but you need to confirm this by doing a spirometry with reversibility test. Asthma is a disease related to hypersensitivity of our respiratory system to some allergens which cause triggering, inflammation in the respiratory mucosa. Undoubtedly you need to take medications else symptoms will get worse as your age advances. So visit a chest physician. I am a practicing chest specialist so I know the pros and cons of the disease. See this asthma is a genetic disease acquired during childhood, and any genetic disease means in genes and currently we in our medical field we are under research for a permanent cure like answers in this genetic diseases field, so my opinion would be visiting a pulmonologist or a chest physician for proper work up and guidance. Chest physician can do a spirometry and total serum IgE levels and as per your need will prescribe you some inhaled medications like long-acting beta 2 agonists and inhaled corticosteroids and maybe some oral steroids as per need which can help you with minimum side effects. Maybe you will need those medications for some duration like three months a year at maybe long or on changing seasons. For more information consult a pulmonologist online -->"

Q. Suffering from osteopenia and osteoarthritis. Taking AcuCal and FreeFlex. Is it safe to take SAM(S Adenosyl Methionine) to enhance mobility?,"Dear Doctor, My mother is 66 years old.

Also If she can take SAM, what will be the dosage and duration. I am asking whether she can take this as a supportive to enhance her mobility. She is a pure vegetarian and on fat free diet. Her weight is 70kg, height is 5.1 feet. Please give your suggestion.","Hi, Welcome to icliniq and thanks for the query. She can take SAM or MSM (Any one of them). SAM is a safe medication. It is a cartilage protective drug and will help her improve some of the pain in osteoarthritis. For osteoarthritis: you have to remember that these medications like free flex, collagen peptides, SAM and MSM are like to help to nourish cartilage and provide some relief. They do not actually replenish the cartilage. I normally advise to take these cartilage supplements for a period of 3 months and gap of 6 months and again restart them. Just check the medication freeflex might contain MSM. Regarding osteopenia, I advise her to continue calcium and consult local orthopaedic surgeon if he can help her with some medications that can build up calcium. If her mobility is restricted, then better to get an x-ray and check the current stage of osteoarthritis and depending on it, we can suggest further treatment. Consult an orthopaedician online -->"
Q. Do I have osteoarthritis?,"Hi doctor, I am a 24 year old female. My BMI is normal. I am fairly active on my feet all day because of work and I used to walk instead of transport. I was a lot more active when I was younger. I used to dance for roughly 20 hours a week and swim five hours a week. Since I have got older and due to injury, I dance for 2 hours a week and swim when I get a chance.Â I was diagnosed with Osgood-Schlatters in both knees when I was 16 and had physio for a year. They used to swell drastically and I still have prominent bony lumps just below both the kneecaps. The only thing that really seemed to help is drastically cutting down exercise as they would become so painful that I could barely walk. The pain comes and goes after an active day at work such as cycling, swimming, driving a long distance or sitting for a long period of time as I am 5'10"", it is regular.Â I have also noticed recently that I have been getting neck and lower back pain as well as regularly feeling like I have strained my right shoulder. I have tried to pass it off as just pain, but it is becoming too often to be a coincidence and cannot help thinking it is linked. I have looked online and read a bit about osteoarthritis and this seems to fit what I have been finding. But, I do not want to jump into conclusion. Do you have any idea what this could be and whether it is linked? Is there anything that I can do prevent it other than cold compression? Thanks in advance.",Hello. 1. Osteoarthritis. 2.

Q. Why do we have pain after deep tissue massage to tight calf muscle?,"Hello doctor,I was suffering from minor Achilles tendinopathy and visited a physiotherapist today to get it checked. During the session, he performed some deep tissue massage on the calf (which was very tight) to relax it, which was very painful. After the massage, I experienced sharp pains while walking (which was not there beforehand), and when I brought this up with the physio, he said it was normal because it was the first time I had gotten deep tissue massage on that area.I have been icing the calf and resting, and while it has gotten a little better, it still hurts to walk. I have my exams tomorrow which I have to get to and other events on the weekend where I have to be (and will involve walking). I am worried about how I can see as I cannot walk at all. Is it normal to experience such pain after deep tissue massage to tight calf muscles, or did I sustain some injury (say a muscle strain or something similar) and need to get it checked out?","Hello. I read your concern. Sometimes, usually, they try to break the trigger points, and it would have caused discomfort. The technique itself is pro-inflammatory techniques and will induce some more inflammation so that healing happens.  So do not worry. Now, I request you to ice your calf frequently like once in two hours for 15 minutes as of now and stretch it properly things should settle down fast. Tomorrow morning you might feel a lot of stiffness in the calf, do not worry as you have to stretch your calf gently and roll your calf over a foam roller or if have somebody ask them to massage it for few seconds. Things will be fine. You can walk without pain. I hope this is helpful to you. Kindly revert in case you need any further information in this regard."

Q. Will Kalarchikai cure multiple ovarian cysts in PCOD?,"Hello doctor, I have multiple small cysts in both ovaries (PCOS). Our family friend suggested me to consume Kalarchikai medicine, powdered mixed with pepper and honey to have it for one mandalam (48 days).

Q. I stopped taking Adderall for some days and it is not effective now. Why?,"Hello doctor, I have recently been diagnosed with adult ADD. My psychiatrist prescribed 20 mg Adderall every morning. I took it for a few days (it worked) and then took a break of two days as I found I was not able to sleep on it. I thought I would get a good night sleep and then resume the meds to see if they were active. After the break, I have been taking them consistently every day and find they do not have any effect on me anymore. My psychiatrist now prescribed 75 mg of Wellbutrin. I also told him that I was having crashes in the evenings when I was taking Adderall. Why would the Adderall stop working so soon? What effect will the Wellbutrin have?","Hello. It usually takes a few attempts to optimize your ADHD (attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder) medication regimen. It can be somewhat frustrating, but your experience is not uncommon. Your doctor will titrate the dose of Adderall (Dextroamphetamine, Amphetamine) according to your clinical response and tolerability. There is some evidence to show that Wellbutrin (Bupropion) is helpful in adult ADHD, especially if you also have any low mood and anxiety symptoms. So continue having regular reviews with your doctor who will monitor your response. Follow proper sleep hygiene measures and try to exercise regularly. It will have a beneficial effect."

I eat healthily, exercise lightly, and manage my stress well. What can I do to fight off this impending depressive episode?","Hello.

You are already on the major depressive disorder, and this is the reason you are feeling bad, isolated, sad, and lonely. Wait for few more days and see if spontaneous improvement occurs.

The doctor says no for milk, but fine to have curd or lassi. I want to confirm if I can have curd and lassi?","Hello.

Q. My brain tests came normal. Do I still need treatment for epilepsy?,"Hi doctor, Is it normal to be treated for epilepsy without an epilepsy diagnosis and all brain tests came back clear? I had three generalised seizures, each of which lasted around a minute in the beginning of this year and none since. CT, MRI and EEG all came back clear. I have recently been diagnosed as B12 deficient and read that this can cause seizures and believe this may have been what caused mine. My aunt also had seizures all in the same day 20 years ago, all tests came back clear. They said it must have been viral. She refused to take medication when leaving hospital as they had told her it was viral, and never had a seizure since. She was then also diagnosed as B12 deficient. My neurologist still expects me to take epilepsy tablets. I am told that epilepsy is the working diagnosis. I never had any health problems in my life until I had these seizures. I took myself off the medication over two months ago due to side effects including that they were making me forgetful, not just forgetting to do something but my mind would be totally blank which really freaked me out as it is not like me at all. My memory is always 100 %. Since coming off them I feel so much better, and my only symptoms at the minute are from B12 deficiency and I am being treated for that with injections. I am 38 years old and female.","Hello. I read carefully your question and would explain that a normal EEG does not exclude seizures. Anyways, there are many other causes that may trigger seizures even in healthy persons like insomnia, alcohol or drugs, thyroid gland dysfunction, electrolytes imbalances, anemia, head trauma, etc. Epilepsy is a disease which leads to repeated seizures in the absence of the above triggering factors or other medical disorders. Coming to this point, as you have stopped medication and you are feeling great, I would recommend just wait and see if you will have any seizures while free of AED. If this happens, I would recommend starting another AED like Levetiracetam in low dose. In the meantime, I would recommend following a regular sleep hygiene, eating a balanced diet, avoiding caffeine, alcohol or smoking. I would also recommend avoiding driving in the next months as we can not predict if seizures will reoccur or not."
Q. I get abdomen pain while walking and standing for a long time. Please help.,"Hello doctor, I am 31 years old 5ft 11"" in height and weight 24 stone.

I suffered from Crohn's disease and had a bowel resection seven years ago, but currently, I remission and my Crohn's consultant does not think this problem is related. I also have a problem with passing urine, as it takes me ages to go and have to strain or sometimes rock and also will sometimes stop mid flow and have to strain to continue. I am worried as the pain become worse this evening.","Hello. Your history suggests the relationship between Crohn's disease and lower right abdominal pain. Gut resection causes this kind of symptom as the overall function is compromised. A post-surgical follow-up visit to the surgeon would be helpful to see whether urinary bladder or ureters were involved. I will suggest you make a post-surgical follow-up with the surgeon and a gastroenterologist for Crohn's disease follow-up.

I went through your report (attachment removed to protect patient identity) and post, the thing which is favoring Crohn's disease is normal biopsy colonoscopy. You need to do ASCA (anti-saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies) and a CT enterography. Your CRP (C-reactive protein) and calciprotein are high.

Q. I lost my hearing capacity due to meningitis. Should I consult a rheumatologist?,"Hello doctor, I had meningitis fever when I was 7 years old because of which my hearing capacity was lost. I use hearing aids and I can hear from hearing aid, but it is hard to listen. One of the doctors said that I have bones issues, and I need to consult with a rheumatologist. But it is hard for me to understand.","Hello. The main problem with meningitis is that it is an infection which causes irreversible damage. As far as knowledge goes, there are not many cases who benefitted with the hearing. The cochlea is the hearing organ of the human body. It has three partitions filled with fluid. When hearing loss is caused by meningitis, the cochlea begins to ossify (the canals in cochlea start turning into bone). Thus the sound vibrations are not able to reach the auditory nerve. Usually, the loss is permanent. If you already wear hearing aids and now having a problem with understanding the speech, you need to see an audiologist and recheck your hearing as it might have progressed. If the loss has increased, please reprogram your hearing aids. If it has not changed, then you need to practice communication perception techniques.

Q. My mother had TB meningitis and is now suspected to have tubercular spine. Help.,"Respected doctor, My 63 year old mother was diagnosed with tuberculosis meningitis (TBM) 10 months ago when she complained of a severe headache. She has undergone CSF study and the report of the study is attached. She has been taking ATT medicines since then. The list of all the medicines she is taking is also attached. The medicines had come down to only one tablet (R-Cinex) in the last 10 months. But, now for the last twoÂ months, she started having back pain in theÂ spine area and is now suspected to have a TB infection in the spine. She has a history of L3-L4 collapse four years ago, but that was due to osteoporosis. Her BMD score was -3.2. The spine has been severely infected from L1 to L5. Â The MRI revealed anÂ abscess with a pus collection in it (report attached). The doctor says it could beÂ Pott's spine and may be because of a drug resistance (MDR), and they wanted to perform a USG aspiration for Xpert plus SRL, culture and sensitivity of pus. But, theÂ test did not happen because the location of the pus was very deep in the muscle and could not be extracted. So, they extracted some tissues near by the infection area and sent for a small biopsy. The report of the histopathology (small biopsy) is also attached. It says mild nonspecific chronic inflammation. SinceÂ no strong evidence of drug resistance could be found in the small biopsy, the doctor has restarted the medicine of AKT-4 plus STM 0.75, and they want to see whether this reduces the problem or not. They said we cannot start DR/MDR treatment without any strong evidence of drug resistance. The current OPD card is also attached in which the medicine has been restarted. Now please guide us about what should be theÂ treatment plan of the disease based on the information submitted. Can anything can be done to get a strong evidence of drug resistance since the ATT medicine is very heavy and theÂ doctor has restarted this medicine only on the basis of his opinion? How can we assess the recovery from the disease apart from relying only on theÂ reduction of pain? Does she require any further MRI or any test after some time?","Hello. I went through your post which has nicely described the events. Also, I reviewed her reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity).

Q. Will Kalarchikai cure multiple ovarian cysts in PCOD?,"Hello doctor, I have multiple small cysts in both ovaries (PCOS). Our family friend suggested me to consume Kalarchikai medicine, powdered mixed with pepper and honey to have it for one mandalam (48 days). I have completed nearly 44 days by consuming one small ball of the mixture every morning and before two weeks I got my periods.

Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well.","Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study.

Q. Can skin prick tests predict positive reactions completely?,"Hello doctor, How accurate are skin prick tests for predicting positive reactions? My family is interested in a pet and I have had negative skin prick and blood work tests for dander. Before we bring a pet in and before my kids become bonded, is it reasonable to assume negative tests will translate in no reactions. Occasionally, when I interact with animals, I have a reaction but it is difficult to determine whether it is actually the pollen which I am highly allergic to.","Hi. Skin prick allergy testing is one of the most accurate ways of diagnosing the allergen, one is sensitive to. It is definitely more accurate than blood immunoCAP testing (blood allergy testing). Skin prick testing checks your sensitivity to the protein in question. Even if sensitive, it need not mean you are allergic. Whereby, a positive result need not always mean you will get allergy with the protein. It means that your immune system is sensitised to that allergen and that an allergy can occur in subsequent exposures to the allergen. A negative in skin prick testing will mean that you are not sensitive to that protein and that you will not end with an allergy upon its exposure. This is true. But it is specific for the particular type of allergen. What all animal danders were included in your profile and what was the response to each? Is there a photograph or record of the wheal or flare that developed after each prick? Was the test read by a clinical allergist or immunologist and were you provided a report as to that you are not allergic to any animal dander? Were you diagnosed with pollen allergy or sensitivity? Have you observed any symptoms of allergy while in gardens or bushy areas? Or in any particular season? Does any one else in your family have allergies?"
Q. How can hair fall be reversed?,"Hi doctor, I am an 18-year-old girl. It had been quite noticeable for some time that I have had excessive hair loss, especially in my hairline. I am a ballet dancer and have been putting my hair in buns ever since I was little. Two years ago, I started training a full time course which meant I needed to put my hair in a bun every day with hairspray, and a lot of times I got home too late to wash it out. Now I am taking more caution but I have lost a lot of hair and my hairline has receded a lot. Is there anything I can do to reverse or help it?","Hello. From your description, it seems like it is traction alopecia that occurs due to excessive pressure on hair roots due to hair bun, etc. First thing is to make sure to relieve pressure from your hair roots. Use Minoxidil spray BD over the frontal area. Take biotin supplements BD for atleast three months. Follow up at one month."

Q. Does itchy red pink rashes mean candidal balanitis?,"Hello doctor, I was diagnosed with candidal balanitis and wanted a second opinion. I have itchy red and pink rash. No open sores or lesions. I had this a month ago and after Diflucan for 14 days it went away but came back this weekend.","Hello.  I understand your concern.  1. It certainly looks like candidal balanoposthitis (attachment removed to protect patient identity), though I would appreciate a photo without flash to see the lesional morphology better. 2. Besides the fact that it can spread via sexual contact and one is advised to get their partner also treated, other precipitating factors like blood sugar should be ruled out. Treatment remains the same as you are already taking it. Get other relevant investigations done to rule out any associated STDs. Take care."
Q. What can be done to cure candidal balanitis soon?,"Hello doctor, I was diagnosed with balanitis about three weeks ago. I got antibiotics and was told by the doctor to keep the area clean and apply an anti-fungal cream. At first, it was super itchy and could not use anything tight. Right now I do not feel it but I can see as you see in the pictures, it is healing. It was my fault to get this so bad because at the beginning it was just red and I thought it was a simple rash because of my sensitive skin but then the rash was so bad that was burning my penis. I just want this to be over, right now. I want to be back to normal but is healing so slow that I am getting desperate. I am using Menaderm Clio, Emuaidmax, Gelmicin, and Cortisone. Not sure if this sensitive area is normal to heal slowly or maybe I am using the wrong medication. They already tested for any infection. Usually, I am very sensitive and I think because I did not pay attention to the initial redness and kept doing a lot of things without taking care developed the severe rash.","Hi. Looking at the picture, features are consistent with candidal balanoposthitis. It is quite severe. Please stop using Menaderm, Cortisone, both are steroid cream, that makes the infection grow rather healing it. Gelmicin has steroid along with anti-fungal medicine. Any history of unprotected sexual intercourse before this rash appeared? Clean the area with lukewarm water, use a mild soap. Apply Clotrimazole 1 % gel or cream twice a day for 3 to 4 weeks. Avoid sexual contact till it heals. You need oral antifungal capsule. Do you know if you have any allergy to any medication? You need Itraconazole 200 mg, one pill twice a day for just one day. It is a single day treatment. Buy two capsules of Itraconazole 200, take one pill in the morning after breakfast and one pill at night after dinner. Please do not take Itraconazole if you are allergic to it. Since it is severe, you may need to repeat the Itraconazole capsules after one month."

"Q. How can a person with PTSD, depression and anxiety be treated?","Hello doctor,What is your recommendation for someone with PTSD, depression, and anxiety?","Hello. If a person is suffering from PTSD (posttraumatic stress disorder), depression and anxiety, they will probably need a combination of medication and psychological therapy to manage their condition. Lexapro (Escitalopram) is a good antidepressant that can be helpful in this situation. Based on more clinical information and formulation, psychological therapy can be considered. CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy) will be helpful in addressing depression and anxiety. If PTSD is the predominant primary condition, trauma-focused CBT or EMDR can be considered.

Q. Why has my 5-year-old been having eczema since she was 3 months old?,"Hello doctor,My 5 years old girl has been having eczema since she was 3 months old. She was scratchy all the time (at least every 3 to 4 hours). Even though we have applied moisturizers such as Aveeno, it was not helping her. When doctors prescribed topical steroids, we used it and she felt better. But as soon we stopped steroids she got the eczema back. As the doctors told we believed that as age progress eczema will subside. But she has even now and in fact it is little worse than before. We stopped steroids about six months back and trying to manage without it. One thing we noticed recently is that when we did not apply any oil or moisturizer (coconut oil or moisturizer never really helped) she did not scratch in the day time. But in the night between 12 AM and 2 AM she has been scratching all the time without sleep and sleep again. We are really worried if she will carry this lifelong and we are stressed. Also, we do not want to use steroid and would like your opinion on that if there is any complication if we avoid steroid completely and just leave her in this routine in the hope of getting better (we do not want her body to get used to steroid).After reading the above points please advise on how we should handle her without much medicine, if possible?Should we avoid moisturizer and oil as she is not scratching in daytime (rough patches still exist though)?When will she get better or at least have less and manageable eczema? Will it be at least at her teenage?","Hello. You have put your query with nice description but I think you have uploaded wrong images. So, if possible share correct images. From your description, it seems atopic eczema. It is endogenous eczema which may have several aggravating factors. Predisposition may come from the hereditary mechanism. Other first or second degree relatives may have features of some kind of allergy or atopy. Seasonal changes may also affect disease course. Some food like groundnut, cow milk, an egg may cause the problem. It starts with dry skin. Then some tiny lesions, sometimes oozing, scaling, crusting. They may coalesce to form large plaques. So we have to put first check on dry skin by use of plenty of moisturizers. It is best to use just after taking bath, tap the water with towel softly then apply moisturizer within 3 to 5 minutes of the bath. And have to apply 3 to 4 times a day as per requirement of skin to combat dryness. The dry or cracked skin may produce stinging sensation: burning sensation initially but it will go on its own. Or you can try a different moisturizer, even a good vaseline or coconut is also perfect. Topical steroids are useful during exacerbation of disease. It comes in different potency, and I hope your doctor had prescribed low-mid potency one. Like Hydrocortisone, Desonide, Flucinolone or Fluticasone. Among these, Desonide is best according to efficacy and safety. There is nothing like being habitual. You can stop anytime. But try to stop in tapering way like initially daily, then alternate day then weekends then stop. Your baby is 5 years old so you have one more option to replace steroids. Topical Tacrolimus 0.03 % ointment. Once lesions are clear by use of steroid then you can shift to Tacrolimus. Or on the face, it is alone sufficient. No need to use steroids on the face. How to manage with minimum medicine: Can moisturiser be avoided? No. Apply with a soft hand, do not massage vigorously. When will she get better? Usually, 80 % child become better by age of 12 to 13 years. But it depends on several factors like family history, exposure to aggravating factors, management of exacerbations. You have to pamper skin of your baby, care during cleaning, tapping, applying moisturizer all needed. There are several another way to treat exacerbation so you should not be worried.

Only redness.The symptoms then disappeared then for four days, I got ticklings on my back, arms, chests, but again nothing visible on my skin. Since two days I have got paresthesia on my left foot, left arm and left hand that does not seems to stop (sometimes I feel it more or less) and sometimes some cramps in my leg or arm. I got a 4th generation HIV test at three weeks, which was negative. Do you think I have a chance to have HIV? Do I need to retest at four weeks or six weeks? If you do not think I have a chance of getting HIV, what options should I look for?","Hello. Oral sex is least related to HIV. Symptoms are very bizarre and mostly by oral sex HSV, and STI is common. The tickling sensation is different as such, may be seen in vitamin B 12 deficiency, and anxiety. Symptoms come but goes in a particular time. You can still go for the HSV test. And STD panel test. No signs you had related to both. Till then you can take, Tablet Mecobalamin (Methylcobalamin) 1500 mg one at night for one month. If you feel better, you can continue for another a month if at all required. Tablet Escitalopram 10 mg (esitelop10) one at night for ten to fifteen days if at all needed. It is not at all HIV. I hope you have understood."
"Q. My penis size is smaller than normal, will it be a problem during sex?","Hi doctor, I am 25 years old and my penis size is 2.2 inch in flaccid state and 5 inch in erect state. I would like to know that, is it a good size because I have read somewhere that 6 inch is normal size. My penis size is smaller than the standard size. What to do now? Do girls think about penis size?Â I also have a small testicle and read that a small testicle cannot produce enough sperm, is it right?Â I am noticing one thing in the morning. When I get up, my penis is in erect state. Is there any problem about that? Please give me some advice because I am planning for marriage soon. Kindly clear my doubts. Thank you.","Hello. Thanks for choosing this platform. 2 to 5 inch of the penis size is normal. The average size of penis is 3-5 inch while erect and 1-3 inch while flaccid. Having said this I like to inform you that penis size does not make things different during sex as only one third of the female vagina is sensitive. So, even 3 inch of penis in erect state provides equal pleasure to both partners. In regard to penis size your fear of small penis is baseless and you can get this idea out of your mind now. Girl may or may not think about the size as it is their domain, but as I said it dose not matter on bed. What you read in pornographic magazines is distorted presentation and does not hold any truth. I do not understand what do you mean by small testicle and low sperm count. It is the number of seminiferous tubules in the testis that matters. Other than that if you are having doubt you can get report of semen analysis which will reveal true sperm count in your semen. Having morning time erection is completely normal and there is nothing to worry about that. If you do not get morning erection that may be a sign of problem.

Q. Will Kalarchikai cure multiple ovarian cysts in PCOD?,"Hello doctor, I have multiple small cysts in both ovaries (PCOS). Our family friend suggested me to consume Kalarchikai medicine, powdered mixed with pepper and honey to have it for one mandalam (48 days). I have completed nearly 44 days by consuming one small ball of the mixture every morning and before two weeks I got my periods. Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged. Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well.","Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study.

Q. Why am I getting white hair in young age?,"Hi doctor, I am 17 years old andÂ getting white hairs. They are white near the scalp and black in the tip. What to do?","Hello. As you are only 17 years old, the primary cause behind it might be genetic as your parents or grand parents may have white hairs at an early stage. The other possible causes might include poor nutrition, improper lifestyle, stress, etc. White hairs mean lack of melanin, the coloring pigment in hairs. Once the hair that grows white, there are fewer chances to revert them back to normal black color. But, you can stop further graying of hairs. First of all add foods like figs, curry leaves, raisins, fresh fruits, and vegetables in your diet. Avoid excessive caffeinated drinks, spicy and junk food. Quit smoking and drinking if you do. Sleep adequately at least for 6 to 8 hours a day. Try to go to bed before midnight. Avoid taking too much stress. As far as medicine is concerned, I suggest tablet Asthiposhak two tablets twice a day with water for six weeks. Apply Bhringraj oil on your hairs two to three times a week one night before washing hairs. Wash your hairs with a mild herbal shampoo. Have one glass of lukewarm milk and add a pinch of black pepper and turmeric in it and take it before sleeping. Try all these things, and you will soon feel positive results. 1. Genetics. 2. Poor nutrition. 3. Stress. Revert after a month to an ayurveda specialist online.--->"
Q. Can you explain the reason behind burning sensation of gums?,"Hi doctor, Whenever I eat spicy food, I feel some kind of irritation, burning sensation and pain in my gums.Â I do not have any cavity in my teeth. I got scaling done 2 years back.Â Once I stop eating spicy food, the pain fades away in few minutes. I would like to know the reason behind it. Please advice me the preventive measures as well.","Hi. Hurting of gums while taking spicy food might be due to the following causes: 1. Gingivitis (swelling and inflammation of the gums) - Swollen gums may be painful and may cause burning sensation and pain while taking hot and spicy food. Gingivitis occurs due to either plaque or other debris accumulating around the teeth and gums. Also hormonal changes occurring during menstrual cycle can cause swollen and painful gums. Any medicines taken for medical issues like hypertension, epilepsy, etc., also cause gum changes and swelling. 2. Any ulcers in the mouth will get hurt while taking hot and spicy food. Ulcers might occur due to faulty tooth brushing techniques, usage of toothbrushes with hard bristles, stress, sharp tooth hurting the tissues, any dental appliances or ill-fitting dentures. 3. Any abscess related to infected tooth might also hurt while taking spicy food. But, you have mentioned that you do not have any cavities or teeth issues. Have you been examined by a dentist regarding this? 4. Any impacted tooth (teeth that remain unerupted due to inadequate space inside the mouth or remain inside the bone itself) may develop swelling of gums around it. When the opposing teeth impinges on this swollen tissue while taking spicy food it gets hurt. 5. Hypersensitivity reactions may occur to certain foods. This might cause swelling, reddening and burning sensation of the mouth. This may occur due to some food additives. 6. Habits like smoking and usage of tobacco products may also cause burning sensation while consuming spicy and hot food. 7. Dental procedures like scaling (cleaning of teeth) might cause minor tissue injuries. These hurt and cause burning sensation while taking hot and spicy food. But, this heals in 4-5 days after cleaning. In your case, this might not be the reason, as you have undergone scaling before 2-3 years. 1. Get dental scaling done, if you have any plaque or calculus deposits causing swollen gums. 2. Get your oral cavity examined by your dentist, for any ulcers, abscesses, infected teeth and impacted teeth. 3. Also get checked for any sharp teeth and any dental appliances or ill-fitting dentures. If found, sharp teeth have to be trimmed and reduced, and ill-fitting dentures and dental appliances have to be corrected immediately. 1. Kindly make a note if you develop any gum swelling, redness or bleeding gums during your periods. 2. Use toothbrushes with soft bristles for brushing your teeth. Also follow the proper brushing technique for brushing your teeth. 3. Make a note whenever your gum hurts and what foods hurt your gums. Check if any food causes the same issue repeatedly. In case, if that food contains some additive that causes hypersensitive reaction, then you may have to avoid that particular food in future. 4.Quit habits like smoking or usage of other tobacco products (in case you do).

Q. My blood group is positive and my fiance's is negative. What problem do we need to face?,"Hi doctor,My blood group is B positive. I am going to marry a person with B negative blood group. Is there any problem?","Hi. I can understand your concern. From history, I hope you are telling that you (male) is B positive and your fiance (female) is B negative. It will not cause a problem in first pregnancy but in second pregnancy severe hemolytic disease of the newborn can occur. So, we have to prevent this sensitization when she will be pregnant. So, just keep this in mind and in first pregnancy of your wife (she is having a negative group as per history), she should be given Rh(D) immunoglobulin injections in the antenatal period at 28 week of gestation. In addition, before marriage, you both should be investigated for thalassemia minor status. For further information consult a hematologist online -->"

Q. How to prevent pregnancy without using a condom?,"Hello doctor, How to avoid pregnancy after sex without condom?","Hi. I am afraid the answer is not so simple. However you can avoid sex in the unsafe period. The unsafe period is the period roughly between 10th to 20th day in a woman having a 30 days menstrual cycle. This period roughly corresponds to the most fertile period in a woman's menstrual cycle. You can also try the withdrawal method where you need to withdraw just before ejaculation, but it needs lots of mental strength on your part. Your partner can also use certain female condom or spermicides also. Use emergency contraceptive methods to prevent pregnancy after having an unprotected sex. But please keep in mind that, all these are never 100% to prevent a pregnancy. Revert back to an obstetrician and gynaecologist online -->"
Q. I have bad faeces smell coming from my nose when I breathe. What could be the possible causes?,"Hello doctor, I have bad faeces smell coming from my nose when I breathe. What could be all possible causes? Nobody around me feels that smell and that is how I got to know that it is from my nose itself. Please advice.","Hello. Bad smell during breathing could be due to various reasons. Let us see those one by one. Malignancy: an intranasal (inside the nose) or intraoral (inside the mouth) malignancy can produce foul smell, that can be perceived as faeces smell by the nose. Malignancy can be painless and without any symptoms. Malignancies of paranasal air sinuses also produce foul odor. Dental infection: a tooth decay can produce bad smell. Dental infection usually produces significant pain. Food particles get collected inside the decayed tooth and hence cause the bad smell. Sinusitis: Chronic sinusitis can cause constant post nasal drip and purulent discharge (pus discharge). This results in foul odor. Maxillary sinusitis commonly produces foul odor. Sinusitis will have other symptoms like headache, facial pain, nasal blockage, post nasal drip, etc. Foreign body inside nose: A foreign body which has got stuck inside nose without being removed for many days will produce purulent discharge and smell. The discharge will be from one side of the nose. It is common among kids. Foreign body produces nasal block. Atrophic rhinitis: It is a disease where the normal space inside the nose gets increased due to destruction of the anatomy. Also the condition causes merciless anosmia (loss of sensation of smell). The sufferer cannot perceive any smell but the people around him can get the extreme foul odor emanating from the patients nose. Atrophic rhinitis also presents with crusting inside nose and nose block. Maggots in nose: Maggots are larval stage of fly (chrysomia). Maggots usually occur in association with atrophic rhinitis. Fly lays its eggs inside nose leading to maggots inside nose. They are attracted to the foul odor and they themselves aggravate the odor. Tonsillitis: Pus accumulated over the tonsil can cause bad smell. Tonsillar enlargement with infection and consequent foul breath is common in many children. Other symptoms of tonsillitis include fever, throat pain, enlarged lymph nodes of neck, difficulty and pain while swallowing. Nasal diphtheria can produce foul odor. Diphtheria produces a membrane over the affected mucosa. Rhinitis caseosa: it is a destructive disease producing foul odor. It was thought to be a fungal disease, exact etiology is still not clear. Tuberculosis: TB of nasal mucosa produces granulomatous inflammation and caseating necrosis, consequent death of tissues and foul smell. Hope I have cleared your query. Further evaluation and clinical examination is required. For further follow up, consult an ENT otolaryngologist online.--->"
Q. I have a burning sensation on the tip of my penis when I pee. Is it due to an infection?,"Hello doctor, Recently I have been experiencing a slight burning sensation on the tip of my penis.

I am uncircumcised and I notice a white substance that seems to be, what I feel is, dripping down. I have not had sex in a while and if I did, it was always protected.

Q. Why do I have bad smell coming from my nose?,"Hello doctor,Why do I have this bad smell coming from my nose? It is embarrassing. People around me smell it all the time. I do not have my mouth open and people smell it soon as I walk in the room. What is it?","Hi. The first thing that comes to my mind is a disease called atrophic rhinitis. Here, the mucous membrane and structures inside the nose shrink and the nasal cavity is filled with crusts, which get infected and smell. In this condition, the patient has decreased sense of smell, but others can feel bad smell coming out from the patient's nose. A diagnostic nasal endoscopy is sufficient to diagnose the condition. It can specify whether it is atrophic rhinitis or something else. If it is at all atrophic rhinitis, the treatment is frequent saline nasal washes and mechanical removal of the crusts by an ENT specialist. Rarely surgery is needed.

The other problem is, if I get erection it is paining for me, I do not really feel comfortable like before. I am also getting some smell around my penis, can it be smegma? What should I do? Is this a serious issue? Why is my foreskin not getting above my penis head and covering my penis like before? Is this normal? Should I go consult a doctor? I am so much confused.

Q. I am a 25 year old male. My body looks feminine. Please help.,"Hello doctor, I am a 25 year old male.Â I am 181 cm tall and I weigh 70 kg. All the members in my family are tall, but I am not that big when compared to my father and brother.Â I am mentally depressed since my childhood. It is all about my body.Â I was a female looking boy with very soft body, less energy and not interested in sports.Â Since that time my arms and legs are very long.Â But arms are very lean as girls. My puberty was too late at around 18 years of age.Â But after puberty, I have hair on face, but till now it is not much as my brother had in that age.Â Facial hair is also thin and not uniform everywhere. I feel my bones are like females and not very strong, arms and fingers are not as big as males. My muscles are less too. I went for gym and built up a little muscle, but forearm and fingers are still feminine. I feel my waist is a little wide. Did I have any genetic problem or hormonal imbalance at puberty stage? I am totally exhausted. I am always worried about that. Please help me.","Hi. I totally understand your anxiety. Based on the description which you have given, there could be a possibility of Klinefelter syndrome. This condition can be seen in about one in 600 boys. A normal male will have a chromosomal pattern of XY. However, in case of Klinefelter syndrome, there would be an extra X chromosome which would have happened randomly during the formation of the egg or sperm, or after the baby boy had conceived.  The extra chromosome is not inherited. So, this condition does not run in families. The adult male body may not be able to produce enough testosterone, the hormone responsible for the development of male characteristics. There may be low energy and sex drive, lack of muscle and too much body fat around the waist. Most men with this condition lead normal lives and also have normal relationships. A few boys with condition may feel shy and may have low levels of self confidence. They may grow quickly than usual and may become taller than other family members. The testicles may be smaller than normal and may not produce enough of the sex hormone testosterone. This may lead to features such as: This condition can be diagnosed by: It is advisable to get treat early in order to avoid further fertility issues. Treatment options available are: A definitive diagnosis can be made only after a complete physical examination and after performing laboratory tests. Visiting an endocrinologist at the earliest would be advisable. Consult an endocrinologist online for further follow up -->"
Q. Is Arjunarishta beneficial for heart patients?,"Hi doctor, I am a 33 year old male. My height is 5'10"" and I weigh 81 kg. I am suffering from anxiety and somatization (as described by my medical report) more than a year. I was under allopathy medical treatment without any remarkable benefit with many doctors as general physician and cardiologist. I was also suffering from some side effects of these medicines. One day suddenly I came to know about the Arjunarishta, then I left all allopathy medicines and started this ayurveda medicine and felt relax within a week. I have been taking Arjunarishta since two months approximately but I still have some problems on and off as 1-3 times in a day. They are congestive pain in chest and neck, irregular heartbeat, hard and pounding heartbeat, pain in left arm, pain in jaw, hot and cold flashes, rarely feeling suffocation or dizziness or vertigo (not together) for 2-5 seconds, feeling relax at morning or when I sleep if feeling any problem. IÂ am feeling one or two symptoms together; I have many normal ECG and blood test when I was under allopathy medical treatment. Am I suffering these current problems because of Arjunarishta? Even I do not want to leave Arjunarishta. Even my parents have also started Arjunarishta. My mother who is 55 years has left anterior fascicular block as in ECG. Is it fine to continue Arjunarishta for whole life?","Hi. Arjuna tree bark has many benefits in the cardiac patients. I suggest you to continue arjuna bark medicines. In your case, the Arjunarishta contains minimal alcohol. So, continuous consumption may cause some gastritis. If the symptoms appear within 2 hours of the consumption of Arjunarishta, then it might be due to the medicine. If the symptoms appear after 3 hours of consumption of Arjunarishta, then it means; it is due the disease itself. Only first 3 hours, the Arjunarishta will control the disease. So, you can consume the arjuna tree bark in different method, such as tablets or powder. This will avoid the bad effect of alcohol in Arjunarishta.

There is no fever and wheezing. The echo shows only mild MR, and TR. No pulmonary hypertension and pleural effusion. She cannot take Duolin nebulization because she is a patient of atrial fibrillation, it increases her heart rate. But atrial fibrillation is under control by medicine. Please suggest the treatment.","Hello. I have gone through all the history you provided here. Your mother is currently suffering from two different problems. Mitral valve replacement followed by mild MR and TR as well as atrial fibrillation, are distinct cardiac problems. And according to you, she is taking prescribed medicines regularly.After going through the CT scans images (attachment removed to protect patient identity), it looks like she is suffering from some infective lesions in the lungs, most probably pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB). She is having breathing difficulty with low oxygen saturation, probably due to underlying lung infection. To confirm the diagnosis, further sputum tests are advised for sputum AFB (acid-fast bacilli) and culture tests. If no sputum sample is available, then induce sputum by nebulization with saline solution or perform a bronchoscopy. You are advised to consult pulmonologist doctor who will evaluate history and will advise recommended tests and medicines if required. Currently, symptomatic management includes oxygen supplementation with a high protein diet. Continue all cardiac medicines as advised. Depending upon the sputum AFB report, further treatment can be planned. I hope I have cleared all your doubts. In case you have any questions please do not hesitate to contact me again. Infection with PTB. Sputum AFB and Bactec AFB Culture. Depending upon sputum AFB report may require antitubercular treatment. Strictly use a mask while coughing and talking."
Q. I have bipolar 2 and panic disorder. Is it normal for me to think that I have psychosis?,"Hello doctor,I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 and panic disorder. I currently take Zoloft and Klonopin. My psychologist believes I am functioning normally, but sometimes I worry that I may be in psychosis, or displaying symptoms. My only concern is that recently, I have been having paranoid thoughts. Nothing extremely delusional, but sometimes I feel like my parents think I am crazy or that they are lying to me. I also had a paranoid thought that my boyfriend was lying to me. The thoughts do not happen very often, but is this normal for bipolar type 2?","Hello. It is common to have some paranoid thoughts, especially when you are feeling stressed, anxious, and feeling low in confidence. From the way you have described your symptoms, psychosis appears very unlikely. You can recognize the paranoid nature of your thinking, and your thoughts do not seem to have delusional thinking. Your report says that you are functioning normally and so I think your psychologist is right. Continue with your psychological therapy to manage your mood and anxiety symptoms and challenge your distorted thinking pattern. I will recommend having regular follow-up with your prescribing doctor to monitor your mental state and seek review if you experience any new symptoms."
Q. Please advice on my blood reports.,"Hello doctor,I did the blood test a few days ago, and the reports state that,1) Monocytes 0.19.2) Red cell distribution width 46.7.3) Platelet distribution width 21.4) Mean platelet volume 13.4.5) Platelet to large cell ratio 50.5.Kindly advice.","Hello. The test is not specific. You need to specify why it was done and what your symptoms are. The test indicates macrocytosis larger platelet than usual, red cell distribution width is higher than normal (11.5 to 14.5). This indicates that your bone marrow which produces all the blood cells such as red blood cells, platelets and granulocyte white blood cells (neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils) and monocyte is not getting enough vitamin B 12 (cyanocobalamin) and folic acid. I do not know are you anemic since there is no indication of red blood cell count there. The cause can be from not getting enough folic acid and vitamin B 12 in your diet, or your intestine does not absorb enough B 12 vitamin, a condition called pernicious anemia from lack of intrinsic factor needed for their absorption. You may be a vegetarian because if you eat enough meat, you would not be having folate and B 12 deficiency.You may have vitamin B12 and folic acid tablets."
Q. Kindly suggest treatment for urticaria.,"Hello doctor, I am a 25-year-old male. I am suffering from urticaria for a long time.

My skin has become so much sensitive that even soft rubbing can cause redness, itching, and swelling. I had not taken any treatment yet because I was told that this would be cured automatically within a short span of time. But in my case, it is getting worse day by day.","Hello. You have new-onset urticaria. Since it has gone on for longer than six weeks, it is now considered chronic urticaria. It is a common condition. Most people will experience at least one episode of urticaria during their lifetimes. There are many causes of urticaria such as 1. Infections-viruses, bacteria, and parasites 2. Drug allergies. 3. Food allergies. 4. Insect bites or stings. 5. Physical causes like exposure to cold. The exact cause cannot be identified in about 50 % of the cases.

Also, I would try a course of de-worming treatment. Albendazole chewable tablets (brand name Zentel) 400 mg. Take it in two doses. The first and second dose should be separated by a week. Take after food, only two doses are required. For symptom relief, try antihistamines. I suggest a non-sedating anti-histamine taken once a day in the morning.If this alone helps, fine, if not, take a different antihistamine at night. Take them daily for a few weeks and then start cutting back slowly and observe. If your itching and urticaria do not respond to anti-histamines, you may need to take corticosteroids."

"Q. Can LSD, DMT, and Ecstasy trigger the borderline personality in seperation anxiety disorder?","Hello doctor, I am 23 years old. I have been diagnosed in the past with (SAD) separation anxiety disorder, autism spectrum as well as ADHD. Lately, I have been harming myself and having trouble controlling my emotions. I sometimes feel as if the whole world hates my guts. Then I feel good again a little while later, sometimes soon, sometimes not even until the next day. As well as some delusions towards those closest to me. Now that I have told you a little about my self. The question is, can separation anxiety develop into borderline personality? Can the fact that I have smoked weed almost daily for the past two to three years and occasionally from age 16 cause borderline. Or can substances like LSD, dmt, and ecstasy trigger the borderline as well? I am having a hard time believing how extreme my emotions are. Kindly advice.","Hello. Yes, separation anxiety disorder might develop in borderline personality disorder (BPD). But based upon the information you provided I am not sure if you have SAD. Smoking weed might increase anxiety, which could worsen the symptoms in BPD. Smoking weed can lead to precipitation of acute psychosis, which can prove dangerous. LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide) or any hallucinogen can increase psychotic symptoms."
Q. Will IgG antibodies take care of the secondary infection in a HSV 1 postive patient?,"Hello doctor, I recently have had tests done after I was with someone that I do not trust after the fact. The only thing I have come up positive for is the common HSV 1. I remember having one outbreak when I was young and no outbreaks after. I have IgG antibodies present in my blood. I fear that the person I was with carried HSV 1 and reinfected me. I hope that my antibodies reacted and destroyed the second infection. I had a blister present on my skin after being with this friend. But it healed up immediately, more than a regular blister. Is there a chance that my IgG antibodies took care of the second infection? I told this person that I had perfect sexual health, and it was essential to me and the love of my life, which I am hoping to find. So it has hurt me at a phenomenal rate. I think of it daily. I need to know if I had IgG antibodies built up before reinfection, can it destroy the reinfection if symptoms are present? My symptom was present one day before it started healing. On the upside, a doctor that looked at it said it was nothing. Other doctors said it was probably nothing. It has cost thousands of dollars to find an answer. I am looking for a true love to live life out with and this is very important to me. Please let me know if IgG antibodies could kill reinfection if a symptom were only present for a day. It has been about nine months, and I have not had any symptoms. If you can help me, it would mean the universe to me.","Hello. I understand your concern. Please follow the following facts.  1. Once you get infected with HSV-1 (herpes simplex virus), as you had been in childhood, IgG antibodies remain there in the blood indefinitely or life long. 2. They help in containing further episodes, so subsequent episodes of herpes are always less in severity than the primary one. 3. Usually, herpes secondary episodes last for a few days, can heal in a couple of days also if it is minimal. 4. You are getting worried too much, and please relax, it has been nine months, there is no need to panic now. 5. You did not mention the site of blisters or any photographs you have taken, and it might not even be herpes. 6. There is no sign of HSV IgG in blood, and it just indicates you had an infection anywhere in the past."
Q. I have allergy and sinusitis so I cannot eat or drink cold items. Please help.,"Hello doctor, I am suffering from sinusitis and dust allergy. I cannot eat or drink cold items.","Hello. Have you done the X-ray of the sinusitis? Sinusitis is inflammation of the paranasal sinuses which are like air pockets found within the cheeks, frontal part of the skull and inside the anterior skull bases. Obstruction to the draining channels of those sinuses lead to blockage and accumulation of secretions which becomes infected and the problem begins. Or there can also be a congenital deficiency in the ciliary cells that beats to drain the secretions into the meatus. You will have to use antibiotics such as Augmentin, use Actifed tablet one tds. Also, you can use nasal drop to help open the ostium so that the mucus clogging it can go out. There is also a surgical procedure, e.g., antrostomy to drain out the maxillary antrum sinuses."
Q. My genital redness exists still after medication. Please help.,"Hello doctor, I am 25 years old male. My problem is redness of the genitals. It has been two months now. It first started from my penis head with four or five red bumps like spots. Then I consulted a dermatologist. He gave me Candid-B cream to apply and some anti-fungal tablets. But I mistakenly use liquid Dettol in water to wash my penis, and it spread badly to my scrotum area. Whole red no itching and no pain just a little red nerves beneath. I have used creams like Onabet, Dermiford k5 prescribed by doctors. And have done 25 days course of Itraconazole 200 mg two times per day. And that with Onabet cream and glycerin lotion. The last cream I used was Betnovate gm, which damaged my penis and gave me a burning sensation on scrotum and foreskin. Now I am applying no cream, only keeping ice pack, and I consulted another doctor. He said after seeing pictures that there is no fungus just irritant contact dermatitis. Please help.","Hello. According to the history given by you, it could be irritant contact dermatitis followed by application of dettol. Since you have used most of the creams and few of it containing steroids, your skin has got thinned, and that is why you could see red colored vessels. It is advisable that you should not apply any cream which contains steroids it could worsen your lesions. Apply coconut oil before taking a bath, no soap on the affected area during bath. Please share pictures of it so that we could start with the treatment. You might need to take oral steroids to improve your condition, but no topical cream. You can take tablet Levocetirizine 5 mg at night time for five days. This is to reduce the itching or burning part but not going to cure it. It is advisable to consult a dermatologist."

Q. Will Kalarchikai cure multiple ovarian cysts in PCOD?,"Hello doctor, I have multiple small cysts in both ovaries (PCOS). Our family friend suggested me to consume Kalarchikai medicine, powdered mixed with pepper and honey to have it for one mandalam (48 days).

Q. Can Seroquel withdrawal cause loss of sensation in penis?,"Hello doctor,I finally withdrew from the drug called Seroquel. But now my penis has no sensation at all. I have much more arousal meaning my sex drive is back. But it is as though 90 % of the sensation is gone. While on Seroquel, I had more, but I stopped the medicine due to many bad side effects. It has been two weeks since my last dose.","Hello. Seroquel is Quetiapine, and the drug is an antipsychotic and mood stabilizer drug. In high doses in some individuals the drug is known to result in side effects like reduced libido, sometimes delayed ejaculation, difficulty in orgasm, etc. But Quetiapine is one of the safer antipsychotics if we compare this drug with other antipsychotic drugs.  The possible explanation of reduced sensation on the penis could be mild withdrawal, which might result in numbness like symptoms, and this may present with symptoms like reduced sensation around the penis. But the dose you were taking that is 50 mg is not a very high dose. Stopping this would not result in much withdrawal except mild insomnia. If we link this with sexual side effects of Quetiapine or Seroquel, then this will reverse by own in coming days. In most cases, sexual side effects go by own in less than four weeks of stopping the offending drug. You were not on a very high dose so that the recovery would be earlier. Prolactin levels increase seen with antipsychotic use (in high doses for a long duration, but some individuals even in low dosage). The standards will normalize in some days, and this will result in an improvement of sensation on the penis. No need to worry, and at this point nothing should be done because your erection is relatively better now, this means libido is improving."

Soltus (Amisulpride) is an antipsychotic medication given to manage symptoms like delusions, hallucinations, thought disturbances, etc. These symptoms can occur in different situations like extreme stress, psychosis, etc. Discuss with your prescribing psychiatrist regarding the diagnosis as he will have a complete history.

Q. I have eczema only in my legs. What to do?,"Hi doctor, I am aware that I have eczema. But, everything I try does not work. I have been having severe eczema since I was 8. I am about to be 19 now. I have tried using unscented lotions, dermatology approved lotions, organic oils and even all of the ointments doctors prescribe me with. The only thing that the lotions and ointments do is calm the irritation. Over the years, I have learnt to resist the urge to scratch unless it becomes unbearable. But, I always find myself sleep scratching. Yeah, I said it sleep scratching. I wake up with tingling legs and can see how hard I have scratched in the middle of the night. I moisturize all the time. Yet nothing works. I am getting to the point where it is starting to interfere with my life. I am young. I want to wear shorts and sundresses whenever I want. But I cannot because of the ugly scarring I have on my legs. I forgot to mention that my eczema is only active on my legs. Occasionally it occurs in my hands and rarely on my arms. Sometimes I even get it on my face. I have tried keeping my nails short so I do not have gross scratch scars but it does not work. I get my nails done because it does not leave scratch scars but it leaves bruises. And do not get me wrong the ointment is the best thing that works but I do not want to have to be wearing that ointment as a lotion. I have to leave to the ladies room about every hour so I can moisturize my legs to prevent the itching from happening but honestly who wants to live a life like that? It has begun to affect my life emotionally and I do not know how much more I can take of it.","Hi. I can understand your concern. Being a dermatologist observes in day-to-day activity few diseases have bad impact on lifestyle, out of which eczema is one of them. But, with your descriptions it seems to be atopic dermatitis, which becomes better as age progress. In adults, it involves the flexural surface eventually localizing to the front of elbows and behind the knees. You need not have to worry that much. Besides medicine, you should do some yoga exercises, which will help you much. Few general measures you have to follow are: In case of oozing, avoid ointment or cream, corticosteroids in lotion form may be used. When there is no oozing or in dry eczemas, corticosteroid cream is to be applied locally twice a day. Local antibiotic cream with or without corticosteroid is helpful where bacterial infection is present. Skin biopsy needs to be done to confirm the diagnosis. Atopic dermatitis.

Q. Why do white spots appear on teeth?,"Hi doctor, I have two small white spots on the lower portion of my front tooth. Can it be removed byÂ microabrasion? Is the procedure worth? Please guide.","Hi. There are several reasons for the white spots on your teeth. Usually, white spots appear when the mineral content in the outer part of the teeth (enamel) is less. White spots could also occur due to high fluoride level in the drinking water or nutritional deficiency during teeth development and infections to name a few. Are the white spots only on the front teeth? Or do you have them on other teeth as well? Microabrasion certainly does not help whatever the cause of the white spots may be. It just makes the surface of the teeth rough and gives rise to other problems. You could consult your dentist and ask whether bleaching can be done. There are other options like placing a veneer on the surface of the teeth. However, a small part of the tooth surface needs to be abraded to place the veneer."

Q. My child developed phobia for terrorist. How to eliminate this?,"Hi doctor, Recently my child seems to have developed phobia for terrorist. She is just 4 years old. I did not know how really she even came to know about the word terrorist. Now, she remains afraid for most of the day and night. She thinks that they are going to come to her. She does not like to go outside the flat and visit public area.Â I think it may be that one of the movies seen recently has left a deep impact on her. We tried our level best to convince her that movies show false things, but somehow the word terrorist has got deep inside her. She keeps talking about them throughout the day. We do not really know how to get this out of her. These things have started very recently and becoming more intense. KindlyÂ help.","Hello. Child's mind is very delicate and easily moldable. Subtle things can cause drastic and unexpected effect on them, which we cannot even predict at times. In your case, it is quite easily observable to you. It is good that you could recognize this change in her behavior so early and decided to take an opinion for the same without wasting further time. Violence and rage have very severe effect on a child's mind. This is what happened with your daughter. The violence depicted in the movie and the reactions caused by that violence in the movie characters have made a deep impact on her mind. The fear caused by that violence had got imprinted on her mind. This can be the beginning of development of an underlying anxiety illness in her. So, it is very important for you as a parent to help her overcome this. You have to gradually make her aware that though the terrorist are the ones who spread violence and chaos, but on the other hand there are good people also who stop them. To begin with storytelling is a good way to inculcate things. Then play therapy can help. You can get her into play activities where you can strengthen her faith that there is no need to be afraid of bad guys and there are always good guys to help with. Gradually start taking her out and expose her to the people in neighborhood. Tell her about different kind of people living nearby. Familiarize her with the surroundings. Besides this, you should avoid watching content depicting violence and rage in front of your daughter. Child's age is a tender part of their life, they learn very quickly. So, use this as a therapy to manage her fear."
Q. How can I divert my mind when I become sad due to the rude behavior of my loved one?,"Hello doctor,I am a 32-year-old woman. The one with whom I am in love sometimes behave rudely to me. He remains silent whenever he dislikes anything that I say. I am a bit outspoken, and I am unable to control this. His silence kills me. I find it difficult to do routine work. I feel so sad and shattered. He will not answer my messages and will not pick up my call even if I had called 50 times a day. I feel like hurting myself. I suffer from depression since childhood, and I am taking Amitriptyline since the last 13-14 years. How can I divert my mind and focus on my work during those times? It happens almost twice a month. We are together for five years now.","Hello. It looks like you and your partner have different personality styles and deal with conflicts differently. For example, if you are an extrovert, you would like to talk your way through issues. But if your partner is an introvert, he may have an aversion to conflict and arguments and may withdraw during stressful periods. This is a natural way of responding to some people and not to be taken personally.  If your partner is otherwise fine and treats you well, it may be helpful to have an open and honest discussion with him when both of you are calm. Write down your thoughts if direct talking can be difficult and ask your partner to reply. Both of you have to respect each other and learn to form your ways of dealing with conflict as a couple. It is natural for all couples to have disagreements, try not to overthink in such situations. Try relaxation techniques and carry on with your usual routines. If needed, you can try counseling or couples therapy. Also, look after your emotional health. Consult your doctor to review your mental health and the need for continuing anti-depressants. I hope this helps."

Will you please suggest, whether these vaccines can be delayed a bit till the suspension of lockdown, or do I need to arrange it ASAP. Really tensed about this unexpected and unfortunate situation.","Hello.  I understand your concern for your child. I would say you can wait for some more time till the end of this month as probably after this month lockdown restrictions will be over. I believe you should go according to your pediatrician as he would understand the situation best at your place. Till then, best hygiene measures should be taken for your child. Use hand rub or wash hands properly before touching your child. Avoid giving bottle feeds. If you maintain this, there should be no problem. All vaccines can be given at a later date."
Q. I need some medications to relax as I am nervous most of the time. Please help.,"Hello doctor, I am a 26-year-old female. I am nervous most of the time and cry a lot because my dad passed away a month ago. I feel like there is no reason for life now, have no goals and moments without happiness. I thought about suicide several times, so I need some pills to relax me during the day time without sleeping effect. What should I do? I will never see my father again, which drives me crazy.","Hello. It is always painful to lose a loved one. Your symptoms are suggestive of an acute grief reaction to the loss of your dad. Grief causes significant emotional distress for some weeks, but usually, you will heal gradually with support from family and friends. To clarify, did you experience any emotional problems or mental health issues before your dad passed away? In that case, the grief can be more intense, prolonged, and you may need professional support like bereavement counseling.  Usually, pills are not recommended for normal grief. But if you have any other underlying emotional problems, kindly consult your doctor who can assess and prescribe according to the need. I will advise not to isolate yourself during this period. Try to go out regularly even if you do not feel like it. Open up and talk to trusted family and friends, tell them how you feel. Try to eat daily and sleep well. Go for short walks and try to do your regular activities."
Q. I am suffering from burning sensation and inflammation in anus after intercourse. Will this be HPV?,"Hello doctor, I am a 24-year-old bisexual male. 10 months ago a friend stroked his penis between my thighs, and suddenly his penis slipped and entered my anus for merely an inches, and he pulled out then we stopped performing it. And after four months I got constipation and hard stools, and then day by day I started to feel inflammation and burning sensation throughout my anus sometimes this burning pain moves to my perianal area and maybe in the rectum. As I read about the HPV infection, I got very scared, and I am in a deep depression. I do not know what this HPV or piles are? Kindly tell me what to do as I am in deep agony, pain, and depression. Please help.","Hello. HPV (Human papillomavirus), usually HPV infection does not cause any noticeable symptoms or health problems. Some time produce genital warts.For your complaints, constipation and burning sensation may be due to piles or anal fissure. So better go for the rectal exam and proctoscopy examination to rule it out. For piles and fissure try these medicines. Kindly consult your doctor to discuss the suggestion and take the treatment with consent. 1. Tablet Pilex 1 t.i.d (three times a day) for 20 days. 2. Tablet Dulcolax (Bisacodyl) one or two for constipation. 3. Proctosedyl ointment use, as per instructions are given in box for 20 days."
Q. 18 weeks pregnant woman used spray pesticide. Is it harmful for the baby?,"Hello doctor, My wife is around 18 weeks pregnant and, she started to spray pesticides inside our home. I am concerned that this might harm our developing baby. Please advise.","Hello. I understand your concern. Definitely pesticides of any category are harmful. If it can damage the pests, then that will be harmful to the baby. But we humans are bigger in size and damage is not significant, unless sprayed daily for many days, for a long time and directly onto the face. By 18 weeks, the baby is fully formed, so there cannot be any significant damage or long term effects on the baby. To be on a safer side better to avoid your exposure to pesticides. Do not worry, and your baby will be ok now. I hope I have clarified your query, do write back if any more questions and for your feedback."
Q. Does side effect of the anxiety drug diminishes the memory?,"Hello doctor, I am a 42-year-old male. When I was 15 years old, I started to suffer from depression and had to undergo psychiatric treatment. I was prescribed Trazonil for a sleep disorder and Flunil for depression and anxiety. I was under this medication for nearly seven years. In the meanwhile, I got hooked to alcohol and smoking before 20 years. I took an overdose and consumed almost 90 tablets of Trazonil in an attempt to end my life. However I survived, but I have felt that it really damaged my brain especially my memory and till today I remember most of the things which took place prior to this incident as well as things I learned, but in my daily life after that I became very forgetful and had trouble remembering things, events or new things which I try to learn. So my question is that is there any way which I can reverse this ill effect or lessen to a high degree so that I can remember things better or have a better memory. I have been drinking for the past 20 years, and since last three years after moving to another place my frequency and dosage of alcohol has increased, and I know it also plays a significant role in diminishing memory. I quit taking medicines almost 14 years back.","Hello. It is good to know that you are insightful about the problems caused by excessive alcohol intake. Have you contemplated cutting down on alcohol? Alcohol may be playing a significant part affecting your memory and also have a negative impact on your emotional health. Your memory difficulties may be more related to a history of depression and concurrent alcohol abuse. It is less likely to be a long term effect of Trazonil (Trazodone) overdose. You may know that alcohol has a depressant effect on the brain (despite the initial euphoric effect). With your history of depression, it is essential and can be tackled at the earliest. You appear to have experienced significant depression, including a risky overdose. You seem to be resilient in your way but are you still depressed? Are you using alcohol as a coping mechanism to manage everyday stressors? I will recommend consulting a doctor to review your mental state and proceed accordingly. You can consider counseling or talking therapy to address issues related to excessive alcohol use. Try reading books. Also make sure you take care of the basics like eat healthily, sleep enough, and exercise regularly. Try yoga or meditation if available locally."
Q. My girlfriend takes Microgynon for PMS. Is it normal for her to experinece spotting?,"Hello doctor, My girlfriend has been taking Microgynon 30 for two months, with two packages back to back. She took Microgynon for suppressing severe PMS. The medicine successfully suppressed the PMS, but there seem to be some side effects. She experienced some spotting for a week, and the other doctor told me that it is normal for a microgynon-taker. Her actual period started the very next day after stoppage of spotting (which is late for two weeks), and it has been lasting for 18 days. In the beginning, the volume is lower than average, but red blood is visible. In recent days, the volume keeps increasing, and it gets me worried about whether some issues are occurring. Should I take her to a gynecologist for a check-up or it is entirely reasonable for a microgynon-taker? We did not have any sexual intercourse before and in the case for an extremely rare accident, she took a pregnancy test, the result was negative. Therefore, pregnancy could be eliminated. She finished her second package of Microgynon around 6/4, and the next day, the blood volume started to increase. One more question, she has a third package of Microgynon and the gynecologist we saw said that she should begin the third package when the second period stops. Is this correct?","Hello. Your doctor is right in saying that this is normal with the medicine you are taking. Microgynon is progesterone. It is a hormone which builds up and helps in the growth of the inner layer or lining of the uterus called endometrium. Due to overgrowth sometimes the endometrium sheds off and appears as vaginal bleeding or periods. The drug is otherwise safe just that continuous bleeding is a nuisance and may lead to anemia. She must take some iron supplements and wear a panty liner. For PMS (premenstrual syndrome), she can try a few things after the course of medicine is finished. She must stop taking tea and coffee. Minimize her salt intake and less water for a week before her expected periods. Also, PMS is a broad term, and treatment depends on what symptoms bother her more."
Q. My husband behaves rudely all the time. Kindly advice.,"Hello doctor,My husband is mostly sad and depressed. He cannot listen a word against him or his family(mom, dad & sister). He gets mad and behaves very rudely with everyone if they do not agree to what he says. He fought with his boss in his company for silly reasons. He abuses me emotionally and mentally. He hides from colleagues and friends about his marital status, to some he says he is not married and to some, he says he is married, and his wife stays with his family and works in a bank (but I live with him and work in MNC). He always uses to tell a lie to me in small things also, he is never ready to accept his fault. Even if it is evident that it is his fault, he will never agree. He was flirting with some girl and went to meet her, and I got to know this when I checked his phone when I confronted him, he got mad at me. He is not ready to accept that he is at fault. He never answers my questions, always diverts the discussion. He does not have any plan. He hates my family for no reason and always say abusive things against them. He says he loves me but never let me live happily. In short, he is still right. Is he mentally ill?","Hello. I can understand your concern. Considering the history of the symptoms you have mentioned, there are few possibilities. One is some underlying mood disturbance which could part of bipolar disorder. This should be appropriately evaluated to make a diagnosis. Repetitive mood swings, keeping grudges, anger outbursts, repetitive lying, etc., are seen commonly.  Such symptoms can occur as part of some personality disturbance. Anger, irritation, etc., could be related to personality issues. Please talk to him and if possible, consult a psychiatrist. Mood stabilizers can be used to control his anger and mood swings."
Q. I am scared to sleep whenever I hear about some accident. Why?,"Hello doctor, It has been around four years that I am always scared to sleep. It usually happens if there is an accident I am scared that it will happen to me too, and I would not sleep for about a week. I am so scared of earthquakes, and many nights, I will not sleep thinking that our building will fall. If there is any news like killing people, I will lock all the doors and windows thinking that I will be killed too. And another thing is supposed I eat at 1 pm for the next two hours I will be full and suddenly I feel so hungry, and in a minute I started feeling so weak and start to shiver. This happens whenever I am feeling hungry.","Hello. Your symptoms are suggestive of an anxiety disorder, which is making you excessively worried about things happening around you. It can be tiring and emotionally exhausting to experience high levels of anxiety all the time. Try relaxation exercises to help manage stress and related anxiety levels. Deep breathing techniques and progressive muscle relaxation exercises will be beneficial. If possible, try yoga as well, and counseling or talking therapy will be helpful. If symptoms are severe and persistent, you will benefit by consulting a psychiatrist for a full assessment and consider medication options as well."
Q. I am worried about my reports. Kindly advice.,"Hello doctor,I had a seven-day monitor, and I have attached my reports. Nothing has been added about whether I need medication, etc. This sounds dangerous. should I be worried?","Hello. Can you upload the report again? I did not get the part narrow complex 5 qrs hr etc. Do you have any chest pain or discomfort heaviness on exertion, or shortness on exertion? These are ectopics or extra beats. These are usually benign and not life-threatening. These are frequently associated with MVP (mitral valve prolapse), caffeine, alcohol, thyroid problems may aggravate these. But, considering your age, we should rule out ischemia in you. You should also get a thyroid test done. So should get a stress test like stress thallium or TMT (treadmill test) done. You will need beta blockers like Metoprolol to keep these under control. If there is any evidence of ischemia, then you can opt for antiplatelets and Statin. I hope this helps you and get back if you have any questions."
Q. What can be done for treating chest acne?,"Hello doctor,I am an 18-year-old male, and for over two years, I have been dealing with a lot of chest acne. I have been told it is folliculitis. I have gone to three different derms who have just prescribed me Benzoyl peroxide washes, sodium washes, Doxycycline, and a bunch of different creams but nothing helped.It has impacted the quality of my life, and I am not sure what else to do anymore. I have been doing a lot of research on fungal acne, and I feel like this is the problem I have. Even though I mentioned this to my dermatologist, she said she thinks it is more bacterial and said to see if it would improve by prescribing me new creams, and that I would maybe have a culture test done later on to see if it is fungal acne. Do you have any tips or recommendations on what I can do to solve my problem? Or does this look like fungal acne?","Hello. I understand your concern. It looks to me like Pityrosporum folliculitis. Some people call that fungal acne too. Does it itch? Please take the following medications for three weeks. Kindly consult your doctor to discuss the suggestion and take the treatment with consent. 1. Capsule Itraconazole 100 mg after dinner once a day. 2. Ketoconazole, 2 % Cream, apply twice a day. 1.

Q. I am getting some rashes after taking Aripiprazole. Should I worry about this?,"Hello doctor,I have started taking Aripiprazole 5 mg tablets, after which I started getting spontaneous rashes. My question is, is this effect worrisome (should I go to urgent care)?","Hello. Aripiprazole can induce skin rashes though it is not commonly reported. It will be safer to get yourself checked to rule out any systemic involvement, especially if you have any fever, pain, signs of the exfoliating rash. Are you on any other medication that can increase the chances of drug-induced rashes? Most rashes are simple and transient, but a few rashes need more urgent attention. So you need to be examined. Depending on the nature and severity of the rashes, you will be advised either to stop or discontinue Aripiprazole. So consult your primary doctor at the earliest."
Q. What has to be done for accidental swallowing of tooth crown?,"Hello doctor, My friend had accidentally swallowed tooth crown an hour ago, she is not facing any problem till now, what should she do, kindly advise.","Hello. I understand your concern but I think as so much time has already passed and by God's grace everything is fine then I think it has not gone into the airway, problem erupts only when it gets stuck in the airway, it might have gone down through the digestive tract and shall pass out normally through faeces. The biggest question is whether it went inside along with breath or food? That will surely subside the confusion and the one who swallowed most probably can feel this. I would surely want to know which number tooth it belonged to in order to know whether it was bigger or smaller in size. Anyway, an X-ray is always advisable for safety if your area is now open for the same. Be careful and look for the engulfed crown in your passed out fecal matter that will also relax you if you find it sooner. It mostly passes out in 24-48 hours. You can have banana so as to help it pass digestive tract smoothly."

Q. Will Kalarchikai cure multiple ovarian cysts in PCOD?,"Hello doctor, I have multiple small cysts in both ovaries (PCOS). Our family friend suggested me to consume Kalarchikai medicine, powdered mixed with pepper and honey to have it for one mandalam (48 days). I have completed nearly 44 days by consuming one small ball of the mixture every morning and before two weeks I got my periods. Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged. Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well.","Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally. Medicine is not of much help."

Q. I am having small black spots on my toenail. Does it indicate melanoma?,"Hello doctor,I am 21 years old. Today I noticed a small black spot on my toenail, I did a little research and found out that it might be a melanoma cancer, but also it could be a fungus infection. After a bit more research, I noticed that an unusual cystic pimple between my chest that I have had for two months now might also sign of melanoma. I spend little to no time in the sun. Do I have melanoma? The black spot on my toenail might be because of the tight shoes I have been wearing lately, my toe also hurts a little bit from those shoes. The red pimple between my chest appeared five to six month ago, then disappeared and reappeared multiple times, I squeezed it, and blood and fluid came out of it.","Hello. I understand your concern. The thing on the chest looks more of a sebaceous cyst, (attachment removed to protect patient identity) which comes and goes even if you pop out the contents as it needs to be excised completely to prevent the recurrence. For the toenail spot, I am not sure that it is melanoma, it can be other things like a subungual traumatic hematoma, or pseudomonas nail infection. Nonetheless, you need to keep observing it for any color or size changes. The two conditions you mentioned do not seem to be related, though. Use the following medication for two weeks, and if it is because of infection it will improve 1. Tablet Ciprofloxacin 500 mg twice a day for two weeks. And avoid tight footwear."
Q. Is it safe to use Montair LC kid in a 4-year-old for reactive airway disease?,"Hello doctor,My son is four and a half years old, and he is suffering from reactive airway disease (enclosing the reports and prescription). Kindly suggest based on the above medication that till how long we can safely go ahead with Montair LC Kid. Is there any upper limit of giving this. I am very skeptical about continuing it in the long run. He is completely fine with this medicine, but if I skip a single dose, he starts coughing just anyways and ends up vomiting everything he had. So I keep on giving him a daily dose of MLC kid. Also, he is a bit aggressive and impatient. I do not know whether these are the emotional changes associated with this medicine. Please tell me that is he losing his natural immunity due to this.","Hello. Please note that the medications prescribed are to the best of my knowledge. Montelukast has been prescribed for patients for prolonged periods extending up to even two years without any problems. It uses has shown reduced requirements of admission and improving the quality of life in patients suffering from hyperreactive airway disease. However, it would be good if we can omit the LC (Levocetirizine) content by just giving Montelukast alone in the form of tablet Montair 4 mg daily at 8 pm instead of Montair LC syrup (Levocetirizine, Montelukast). The Levocetirizine component may cause dry mouth, sleepiness consequent irritable behavior in very few children if given for prolonged periods. The tablet (Montair) can be crushed in a small cup of water, and the child can consume the paste or solution. Most of such cases usually get alright as age advances with complete remission by the age of six to eight years. Very rarely this may persist till 10 years. If it continues until the age of 10 to 12 years, it may progress into asthma in adulthood."
Q. Kindly advice about the diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia.,"Hello doctor, I am concerned about my friends medical diagnosis about paranoid schizophrenia is fabricated by him and resulting in unnecessary medication. Kindly advice.","Hello. The diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia is not easy. Proper evaluation by a psychiatrist is needed to make the final diagnosis. The individuals with schizophrenia show symptoms like hearing voices talking or voices are giving commentary, suspiciousness against anyone or even family members, ideas of prosecution, ideas of reference, etc. These should be present persistently, and in usual cases, there is no insight about the symptoms. It is the family and friends who take the patient for evaluation and not the patient he or herself visits the doctor for a diagnosis. Yes, depression or anxiety can be the possibilities, but these too should be evaluated. Symptoms of depression like low mood, anhedonia, reduced energy, fatigue, negative thoughts, bad thoughts, lack of surety about future, feelings of helplessness, worthlessness or hopelessness, etc. are seen.If he has doubts about his symptoms, he should be evaluated by a psychiatrist."
Q. Do my symptoms indicate bipolar disorder or schizophrenia?,"Hello doctor, Since I was around 8 years old, I have experienced mood fluctuations but not in the normal bipolar way (which I am being tested for). I do not feel like my mood sways between depression and mania. It is always some level of mania but without depression. I also experience tactile hallucinations such as something grabbing my leg, ants or bugs crawling up my legs as well as something breathing on and grabbing my arm. Tension headaches are also common, and intrusive thoughts pretty much ruin my life. Another common occurrence is I notice I have trouble talking, not in a word salad kind of way, but a slurred sometimes mumbled speech. My Psychiatrist says it is likely bipolar, but I do not think that that is the only possible diagnosis. To me, it seems more closely related to schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. All I want to know is that is there a possibility that I am correct? Could it be a schizophrenic related disorder? In the past, they gave me Citalopram for anxiety.","Hello. Yes, your psychiatrist is correct. Bipolar is a more likely diagnosis. Bipolar disorder need not be present with depression and mania both. Recurrent mania also comes under the category of bipolar disorder. In mania, our sensitivity to stimulation increases like colors appear more bright, music appears more appealing and smoothing, also hallucinations are common in mania too. Schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder diagnosis are made only when there are criterias of disease which get full filled. You can refer ICD 10 bluebook for detailed criteria. To me also, the diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder and schizophrenia is less likely."
Q. What are the ways to control schizophrenia?,"Hello doctor, My son aged 32 years is suffering from schizophrenia for the last six months and not accepting any treatment and since the last 10 days his symptoms got worsened and became violent and today he tried to get injured and he is suspicious on everybody thinking everyone is talking about him and plotting to harm him and asking us to kill him by giving poison and today he became very violent and after consulting a psychiatrist doctor today we gave him Risdone liquid 2 ml by mixing with fruit juice. Now he is sleeping calmly tonight. Please help us for further treatment.","Hello. I can understand your concern. A lot of patients of schizophrenia or other psychotic disorder refuse to take medicines and this becomes difficult in treatment. Risperidone liquid is tasteless and odorless and can be given without knowledge to the patient. But keep one thing in mind that he should not become suspicious that he is being given medicine by mixing with food. Most of the patients come to know about this. You will have to remain alert for this. This should be followed strictly. In coming days he will become ready to take medicines by own. Till then you can give him Risperidone liquid. He is on 2 mg per day and if needed, the dose can be increased to 3 mg per day. The second option in his case if he refuses to take even food or juices from you is long-acting injectables. Long-acting injections of Haloperidol or Fluphenazine or Risperidone or Paliperidone are available. These have actions for around 15 days and can be given to him if he refuses to take medicines. This can make treatment easy for him. You can discuss with his doctor for this treatment option."
Q. Can herpes cause cold sore on lip?,"Hi doctor, I have had a bad cold sore 8 weeks ago on my top lip and a bit of the skin above it. I used Zovirax externally 2 weeks course and Acyclovir 2 weeks course to treat it. The actual sore improved, the blister stopped weeping, the scab formed and flaked off within 3 weeks but the redness is still lingering. I rung the doctors that put me through a pharmacist who told me to use Hydrocortisone 1 % cream. I used it for a week as he recommended but it still did not go away. That was two weeks ago. I also had a new flare up three days ago. Also on the top of my lip symmetrical on both sides. It looks different to a cold sore in that it was some redness and skin flaking. Home remedies I have tried so far: Aloe vera (not much help), Tea tree oil (irritated it), Manuka oil (helps healing where the sore is but seem to irritate the new flare up), Coconut oil (irritated it), Almond oil (seems to soothening it at the moment). I am worried if this is still unresolved herpes/cold sore and can be transmitted to my partner who does not have herpes. Is it contagious and am I able to kiss my partner?","Hello. As per the current picture sent by you, it does not look like a cold sore as of now (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Also, I would advise to stop all ongoing treatment (including the Hydrocortisone) and just leave it alone for a week. Apply Dologel only. It contains Cholinesalicylate along with certain other ingredients that help to heal. No application of any lipstick or any other ointments or creams to the region. I would not advise kissing for 2 more weeks atleast till things resolve to prevent spread. Also, limit alcohol intake if you are currently consuming alcohol. Avoid spicy foods too to promote healing."
Q. Are my symptoms suggestive of schizophrenia or OCD?,"Hello doctor, I am looking for an appointment with you firstly for reassurance I suppose and then CBT rather than waiting for the NHS. I have had OCD since I was a teen (intrusive thoughts and having to touch wood, say prayers, etc.). This seemed to subside until I had my daughter but then flared up again after and I was misdiagnosed with postnatal and placed on Citalopram. After a couple of years, I came off the tablets and was extremely stressed. Then suffered what I now see as an OCD relapse. I was petrified. I was losing my mind. Researched schizophrenia and almost gave myself all symptoms, suffered depersonalization on the commute home from work and spiraled into an anxious mess. I took myself to a doctor and was adamant I was psychotic. I was screened and told that I had bad anxiety and OCD. From here, I was put on Fluoxetine and things got a lot better. Five years later, I am going through a lot of stress and I stupidly did not take the tablets every day for a period of time. I am now again riddled with OCD thoughts and feelings around schizophrenia. I am my own worst enemy as I know if I had schizophrenia I would not query it. I would believe irrational things. So in turn, my OCD tried to confuse me and I do believe the thoughts. I do not want to carry on like this please help. I am a working mother.","Hi. I understand you must be going through a tough time. First of all, please do not stress yourself so much with whether it is OCD or schizophrenia or what not. You are much more than a diagnosis. It is important you are at peace and have some relief from the distress. Coming to your symptoms, you have said you have intrusive thoughts but what kind of intrusive thoughts do you have? And apart from saying prayers and touching wood is there anything else that you do? From your history, it does seem that you are having severe OCD which is causing a lot of anxiety. If Prozac has helped you in the past, you can reconsider the same medication but you will have to take it for longer duration like two years or more and at a higher dose like 60 mg. Consider tablet Clomipramine 20 mg along with Prozac for an augmentation effect. For acute anxiety, you can consider tablet Etizolam on SOS basis. As for psychotherapy, rather than CBT, exposure and response prevention seems to be a more helpful option for you but we can explore more on that only when we know the exact nature of your intrusive thoughts. Please look up progressive muscle relaxation techniques. These will help you gain some control over your anxiety symptoms."
Q. I have something like genital warts. Please confirm if it is the same.,"Hello doctor, I have a few and little genital warts in my vagina. I can send you a picture if you want, I am very worried that it could be VPH. Please help me.",Hello. It seems to be HPV (human papilloma virus) warts only. But need to be confirmed.

Q. My baby has constipation and gas problems due to Dexolac. Should I change the formula milk?,"Hello doctor, My daughter is a premature baby. Her birth weight was 1.7, and now she is 2 months old and weights 3.1. Our doctor suggested dexolac special care. She is suffering from constipation, and gas problem after having it. The doctor suggested medicines, but there were no changes. One to two days she was fine, and the next day the same problem started again. She is mostly crying at night and not sleeping. Can I change formula powder? What powder is the best for my baby? Please advice.","Hello. Please note that children below the age of 6 months pass stools either once in two to three days or 10 to 15 times per day. It is normal, and it is not labeled as loose motions or constipation. If you are labeling it as constipation because of hard pellet like stools, then I would advise you to increase the water content of the top feeds and see. As far as the gas problem is concerned, it is also normal. Nothing is to be done. Almost all babies have gas just like a normal adult. There is no medicine for the same because it is normal. You can calm down a crying baby by either singing (light tones), suckling (allowing baby to suckle), swaddling (wrapping the baby in cloth), swinging (putting the baby in a small too and fro motion). You can also tap slowly on the stomach to reduce discomfort as and when required."
Q. I always feel like third person is ordering me. Kindly advise.,"Hello doctor, I am suffering from depression. It has been four years. I am always demotivated.

I always feel like third person is ordering me and I get tired answering them. I feel like I have become a small child of second grade.","Hi. The symptoms like someone is talking to you, talking to God or hearing voices which others cannot hear could be occurring due to some psychotic issue.

Q. Why is my penis not getting hard during sexual intercourse?,"Hello doctor, I recently got married but when I started having sex with my wife, I started noticing that my penis is not becoming hard enough to have sexual intercourse. Also, sexual arousal is also not happening. I believe I am suffering from erectile dysfunction. Kindly advice what I should do.","Hi. Erectile dysfunction can occur because of many factors like diabetes, hypertension, thyroid disorder and also due to stress and psychological problems. So, visit a nearby psychiatrist to find the exact cause and then act accordingly. If there is no physical or medical condition then, Sildenafil or Tadalafil will help in erection and these drugs can only be used after discussing with your doctor. Meanwhile, spend enough time on foreplay. You can take few days for only foreplay and proceed to sexual intercourse only when you feel that you are fully erect. Avoid any substance abuse like alcohol or tobacco. Take adequate sleep. Do regular exercise like morning walk for 45 minutes daily. Do exercises of pelvic muscle like kegels exercises."

Q. What are the ways to manage the withdrawal symptoms of Benzodiazepine and Alprazolam?,"Hi doctor, I took Benzodiazepine Alprazolam for insomnia for 2 months for a total dose of 30 mg, while stupidly attending college parties and binge drinking once a week during the period (I have never taken the pill on the day I was drinking). I did not take the drug every day and after roughly two months I quit the drug altogether, the withdrawal, that I did not recognize at the time, kicked in (Extreme tinnitus, sweating, heart racing, heightened anxiety). I went to ENT doctor and she gave me two Dexamethasone injections in 3 days (I think 8 mg). I developed during these 3 days a major loss of short term and then long term memory, trouble finding words, trouble learning in general. The physical symptoms of the steroids and benzo withdrawal went away in 2 weeks. It has now been a month since I feel physically fine, but the cognitive issues persist and they do not get better at all. I have been to a psychiatrist because I felt overwhelmed that Iam not going to be able to finish school in such a state and she gave me Escitalopram thinking it could be psychological, but there is no improvement in cognition after a months use. Does that combination have that drastic side-effects and could it caused a chemical or structural problem in brain? What can I do to return somewhere close to my old self? I am 24 years old.","Hi. People taking Alprazolam should not combine it with alcohol and avoid combining it with other medications, such as narcotic pain relievers, that cause drowsiness. Doing so can cause additive drowsiness and reduced breathing as well as other side effects, which can be dangerous and possibly fatal. Alprazolam may be habit-forming when taken for long periods of time. If you have been taking this medication regularly for a long period of time (more than one month), do not stop taking the medication without speaking with your doctor. A gradual reduction in dose is recommended when stopping this medication to avoid withdrawal symptoms.  Escitalopram works by blocking the reuptake of serotonin so that there is an increased level in the brain. Serotonin is an important neurotransmitter responsible for mood and well being. It is usually taken once daily and may take a few weeks to months reach maximum therapeutic potential. So continue taking Escitalopram until you see significant improvements in your memory."
Q. I hit my forehead against a wall and got a scar. Can I treat that scar?,"Hello doctor, I hit my forehead against a wall and had a small cut on my forehead and now it has healed and it looks like a scar. Will I have a permanent scar?","Hi. First, you need to understand that scar treatment depends on its depth and lenght. Whether your scar is permanent or not, it is very important to evaluate it. Mostly scar lightens and becomes equal to the surrounding skin with passage of time. However, scars which are deep becomes permanent. Such scar will not go away with any creams or gels. Best treatment for permanent scar is reversal by plastic surgery or it could recover to some extent with C02 laser."

First of all I would like to inform you that Codeine can be stopped in gradual manner.

Q. Kindly explain about the diastolic heart failure.,"Hello doctor, I am a 41-year-old male with 5'11"" height and weight 214 pounds. Multiple sclerosis and bipolar disorder are co-morbid conditions. I was recently admitted for a heart catheterization to check for any potential blockage after an abnormal ECG, chest and chin pain, months of breathlessness, and a very strong family history of cardiovascular disease. Fortunately, no blockages were found. However, my cardiologist informed me that I had diastolic heart failure. To be clear, he did not say diastolic dysfunction, and he said heart failure. My high blood pressure has always been controlled. My reports say,  1. Moderate tortuosity of epicardial vessels consistent with hypertension. 2. Hyperdynamic left ventricular ejection fraction of 75 to 80 %. 3. Moderate to severely elevated left ventricle end-diastolic pressure 24 mm Hg. My cardiologist never gave me a prognosis. He told me to eat a low sodium diet and to get checked for sleep apnea (which I will do), but he never gave me a prognosis. I have dealt with health problems for a very long time. It is essential for me to know what a diastolic heart failure diagnosis means for my lifespan. I am married and have five children, and it would be nice to know what I am looking at. Kindly advice.","Hello. I am sorry to hear that you did not receive any detailed explanation of your condition. Diastolic dysfunction is the inability of the heart to relax, which can be diagnosed with echocardiogram or with evidence of high pressures inside your heart chambers, as evidenced by the increase LVEDP (Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure) in your cardiac cath (it was 24 mmHg, and normal is considered less than 15 or 18 mmHg). The term diastolic heart failure is used when we have evidence of diastolic dysfunction as above in addition to symptoms of heart failure (the shortness of breath you described). There is some belief that diastolic heart failure is more benign than systolic heart failure, but in reality, that is not the case. They have similar prognosis when compared in general. However, patients with advanced systolic heart failure have a worse prognosis than those with diastolic heart failure. The complicating aspect is that there are no many proven therapies that work for diastolic heart failure, other than low sodium diet, diuretics, exercise, proper eating, and lifestyle modification. To provide a more precise diagnosis, it would be essential to understand how is your exercise tolerance, however that can be challenging with your multiple sclerosis. I hope this information helps. I do not want you to feel discouraged but instead focus on lifestyle modification. Eating well, stress reduction (mindfulness or mediation can help) and practice physical activity. Hypertension, and obesity. Possibly an exercise stress test to objectively assess your exercise capacity, sleep study, and probably a Holter or event monitor (to assess for arrhythmias or atrial fibrillation)."

But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally. Medicine is not of much help."

Q. My husband gets frequent sharp cramps in right lower abdomen lasting for a minute. What could this be?,"Hi doctor, My husband gets sharp cramping in the lower right side of the abdomen over a period of two months. It happens once or twice a week and lasts for a minute. We checked for appendicitis and kidney stones and all the reports are negative. We did a CT scan of the abdomen and it came normal but with a finding of stage 1 fatty liver. Can you please help me understand what is his issue?","Hello. I will definitely help you. Right lower abdomen pain has many reasons including appendicitis and kidney stones. There are some other reasons like indigestion of food, infection of the small intestine, or worm infestation. This may be functional also in which no cause is identified. The main reasons are indigestion and irritable bowel syndrome in which all investigation were normal. So if a CT scan is normal and there are no other complaints like vomiting, bloody stool, urinary complaint, constipation then it must be functional due to indigestion. Avoid fatty and spicy food and lots of water have to be taken Give two-hour gap between dinner and going to bed. Please get back to me if any of the above symptoms are there and attach an investigation report also for better help."
Q. Can starving for longer period make you eat more?,"Hello doctor, I have started to notice something about my eating habits. I noticed that I have gained a lot of weight this year. And I have even been eating food that I do not like. I get hungry so many times during the day, even though I already ate. Last year, I would not say I was on a diet. But, I hardly ate much. I was wondering if that is the reason why I am gaining this new eating habit. If you starve yourself for a long period of time, will it trigger you to want to eat more? This is a serious concern of mine, because I have never been such a big eater.","Hello. If you starve for a long time, your body demands for more carbohydrates to complete its metabolism. If the starvation continues for a long time, the body starts accumulating energy for the period of starvation, hence you feel to eat more. The best way is to provide lots of fluids and fibres so that you feel full and avoid carbohydrates and junk. Decide your meals to 5 to 6 meal pattern, increase protein fibre, you will maintain weight. If gained, start with exercises for good result."
Q. How can IBS related to SIBO be managed?,"Hi doctor, I realize I have IBS symptoms and they seem to be related to SIBO. I need your advice on how to treat it effectively. Here are some symptoms and test results. Leaky gut or intestinal permeability with multiple food intolerances. Seems to have hydrogen sulfide based SIBO, severe farting with a foul smell of eating foods like cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower, high protein foods. I may have an overgrowth of sulfate-reducing bacteria. Rifaximin seems to help with SIBO but it is temporary. I have to eat rice as I cannot eat gluten or wheat. Some experts on SIBO say that MMC or vagal nerve dysfunction is the root cause of SIBO. I have heard a lot of patients get better when they increase gut motility. So I wanted to ask if taking prokinetic or cholinergic support will help SIBO from reccuring.","Hi. The best is to avoid eating foods that cause trouble. Secondly, for SIBO (small intestinal bacterial overgrowth), it is better to use a combination of Tetracyclines plus Metronidazole for two weeks. Effective probiotic will also help. Take the following medications: 1. Tablet Tetracycline 500 mg thrice a day two weeks. 2. Tablet Metronidazole 400 mg thrice a day for two weeks. 3. Take a good probiotic for two weeks at the end of the previous two drugs. 4. Take fresh homemade yogurt twice daily in a small bowel."

Q. Is there a permanent remedy to get rid of psoriasis?,"Hello doctor, I would like to know a few details of the tablets whichÂ I have been taking for my scalp psoriasis. Winolap 5mg once in a while when itching is too high (without doctor's prescription). Isotretinoin drugs/other drugs (with doctor's prescription). I have been taking these medicines on a regular basis and were very effective. But only till I take them. If I stop the medication, I have to visit my doctor again and start medications again to get some relief from itching in scalp. I want to know if these medicines will cause harm/side-effects in future? Can these be taken continuously?","Hello. Isotretinoin is a potentially dangerous drug and in many countries there are very strict guidelines over its use.

Q. I heard one of the reasons for psoriasis is lack of Vitamin D. Is it true?,"Hi doctor, I am suffering from psoriasis for the past 24 years. I have tried a lot of ointments already. I heard one of the reasons is lack of vitamin D. Is it true? I am 54 years old now.","Hi. Psoriasis is a T-cell mediated autoimmune disorder. What you have heard about lack of Vitamin D as its cause is a myth among patients because nowadays there is a new class of topical drugs available which are analogues of Vitamin D. These reduce the excessive cell proliferation and differentiation seen in the skin cells of a psoriasis patient. A few of these drugs are Calcipotriol, Calcitriol, and Tacalcitol. Their pros are that they do not cause skin atrophy, but they are useful only for stable and moderate psoriasis. To help you better, I need photographs plus a detailed history with a previous medication you had taken."

There is a large area of redness in my buttocks,is it psoriasis?","Hello doctor, For a couple of months, I have had a red area between my butt cheeks (not anus, further up where butt cheeks meet). This developed on the right side as a large area of redness which now feels scaly and a bit raised. At times it may feel moist, watery, not quite bleedy though. I tried an athlete's foot antifungal spray which I think helps a little bit, but it comes back again. Is it psoriasis or fungal infection or just irritation?

Q. Sore throat did not go away with several antibiotics. How can I get well again?,"Hello doctor, I am a 27 year old lady. I started having a sore throat two months back. I just thought it was a flu coming. But then, when I noticed that it had been on for two weeks, I decided to take Amoxicillin. I took it but did not finish the course on the last day. I had traveled and forgotten them at home. The sore throat went away but came back a few days later. I took another full course of Amoxicillin and during the course, the sore throat went away. I finished the full course but a few days later, the sore throat came back again. I went to the clinic and the nurse noticed that my throat was inflamed and prescribed Erythromycin. I took it but the sore throat kept on coming back. The nurse then prescribed Ciprofloxacin. I took the full course but still the sore throat did not go away. When I went back to the clinic, the nurse said it was no longer inflamed but I could feel it, but only that the discomfort seemed to be going deep down the throat. It is like each day I can feel it is moving down. It is not a very painful sore throat. I do not take any painkillers. My body temperature and blood pressure are normal and have been normal throughout the period. Right now, I can feel discomfort in my upper part of the chest. Another thing is that the first episode of sore throat occured after I visited my sister who from time to time gets swollen glands (below the ear). What could it be and how can I get well again?",Hello. I have gone through your complaints. Repeated attacks of a low-grade sore throat suggest that it could be chronic pharyngitis. The other common causes of chronic sore throat are due to acidity and gastroesophageal reflux. That means stomach acids pop into esophagus silently and burn the throat in the nights. You should undergo upper GI esophagoscopy and a throat swab to rule out infection. Try taking antacids for a week. Do not take antibiotics. I think this would suffice.

Q. I get bloody semen with clots and pain in my right testicle. What is my problem?,"Hello doctor, I am a 33-year-old male. I have not had any previous health problems, non-smoker, and non-drinker. Generally, I am feeling fine. For the past six months, I have produced bloody semen with blood clots and producing more recently. I have also recently started feeling mild pain behind my right testicle. Occasionally, my left testicles seem to change in size slightly and seem to almost disappear and the right testicle becomes quite tender and firm. I had an ultrasound scan about six years ago and there was found some cyst but little concern. About a week ago, I sensed a small lump rising above my right testicle to my lower abdomen, it was uncomfortable but I slept and the discomfort eventually went away. I see little blood-colored spots appearing on my arms and torso perhaps resembling perhaps petechiae and have an area of this rash on my torso that I am not sure may be related to my concern? I have been taking Azithromycin since yesterday incase it may be a virus or something bacterial but it does not seem to be helping the problem. I had a blood test in January 2020, but have not been able to make a follow-up blood test yet. Not sure why it might be necessary. What does the problem sound like to you?","Hello. Hematospermia (blood in semen), is fairly common. Generally it is not considered as a sinister sign. There are whole list of possibilities for this theoretically, but once we ensure it is not due to sinister cause and rule out treatable causes say like infections we do not beyond that as it will not affect the management. Sinister causes mainly prostate and testicular cancers. At your age prostate cancer is extremely unlikely but need to ensure no testicular problem. With your symptoms with testes, you need another scan to be on safe side as the scope for examination to be conclusive. I suspect you have epidydimal cysts which are very common and can cause pain, etc. So if the scan does not show anything other than this, I would not worry about it at all. I think the rash is completely unrelated to this or any of your urological problems. Nor the rash or hematospermia is related to old history of chlamydia. Since you have not had any other urinary symptom, I would not worry much about other tests related to urinary tract. However, I would also recommend sending semen for culture to see any infection in it. Lastly about prostate cancer virtually unheard in your age. Finger examination of prostate, PSA blood test and MRI scans of prostate are the screening tests in general. But not something I would recommend if testes scan comes back normal and if you are still worried an MRI then will be helpful as last resort. Idiopathic. Testicular pathology. Ultrasound scan of testes. Ideally an examination of genitals including prostate by a clinician. Semen culture. Idiopathic. Hematospermia. With reports."
Q. I am getting pimples and dark spots. How to treat it?,"Hi doctor, I am having skin problems for the two months where pimples are like faint and after it disappears that spot becomes black. Please help.","Hello. I will help you with your problem. You are having acne vulgaris which is the most common skin condition of your age. Generally, the eruptions on healing leave a mild dark spot. If the eruptions are manipulated by picking them or squeezing them, they leave darker spots on healing. In your case, if you are having oily skin, you should use Ahaglow S facewash four to five times a day. This will prevent oily skin which is one of the main causes of the acne. For the treatment of the eruptions, you should use Deriva CMS gel on the eruptions at night daily. Also take tablet Azithromycin 500 mg three days a week for 1 month (3 days daily dose, then 4 days gap, then repeat). The dark spots, if persist after the course of treatment, can be treated by other creams then. Acne vulgaris. As mentioned above."

Q. Will Kalarchikai cure multiple ovarian cysts in PCOD?,"Hello doctor, I have multiple small cysts in both ovaries (PCOS). Our family friend suggested me to consume Kalarchikai medicine, powdered mixed with pepper and honey to have it for one mandalam (48 days). I have completed nearly 44 days by consuming one small ball of the mixture every morning and before two weeks I got my periods.

Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well.","Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study.

Throat swab and culture or RADT (rapid antigen detecting test). URTI (upper respiratory tract infection). If culture is positive then I suggest Tablet Amoxicillin 625 mg twice daily or tablet Amoxicillin 500 mg thrice daily for 10 days.

Q. What does positive strep test mean?,"Hi doctor, I am 24 years old. I have had a sore throat every day for almost a month. I had antibiotics already, but it did not work. What could be wrong with me? It is chronic and I have been more tired with this. Sometimes, I am getting a fever and belly pain. My laboratory test showed strep test positive. What to do now? Please help.","Hello. I understand that you have done strep test, which is a rapid test to find out whether the pharyngitis has bacterial origin. The strep test is positive and this means most probably the Streptococcus pyogenes detected in your throat is the causative organism for the pharyngitis. The strep throat infection has to be treated with appropriate antibiotics. I suggest you take a course of Amoxicillin and Clavulanic acid (625 mg) twice daily after food. Take supportive treatment in the form of salt water gargling of the throat, anti-inflammatory and pain killer tablets. Also avoid spicy, oily and masala-rich foods, which aggravate the throat irritation. As a painkiller, I suggest tablet Paracetamol 650 mg twice a day. Anti-inflammatory tablets are combinations of trypsin-chymotrypsin enzymes. If you do not get relieved with this antibiotic, then I suggest you go ahead with a throat swab culture and sensitivity. That will tell us about the details of the antibiotics to which the organism is susceptible and resistant. With your blood pressure values, I see that they are towards the higher side. However, if it was measured using a digital BP apparatus, it is bound to be erroneous. Kindly visit your GP and get your BP checked. Manual measurement of BP is the preferred method. At your age, it is unlikely that you have this high BP. For further information consult an ENT otolaryngologist online -->"
Q. What can be the reason for raised liver enzymes during fever?,"Hi doctor, The issue is from 39 years ago. When I was 13 years old, I was considered for the possibility of poisoning.

The almond size lymph node on the left cervical chain and the right side lymph was golf ball size. The neck was supple, no rigidity and some restriction of movement. There is no mass or thyroid palpable. The rest of the physical examination is within normal limits. Total bilirubin 0.4, ALT or SGPT was 714 initially and on discharge it was 215. SGOT or AST was 426 initially and 202 on discharge. LDH was 297 and then 217 on the day of discharge and albumin 3.8. Â I am trying to figure out why my liver enzymes were so high initially and 8 days later they came down. I was treated with Keflex IV antibiotic, which cured the infection. Mono spot was negative.

Q. What is the degree of burns in a baby injured by boiling water?,"Hello doctor, 1 year and 10 months old boy got injured by boiling water, the doctor pricked some of the blisters.

He is around 10 kg. The genital parts also have some blisters. Picture has been attached. The white area on the picture is Flammazine cream that the doctor prescribed. Should we find another hospital, is it serious?","Hi. This qualifies for approximately 9 percent burns (attachment removed to protect patient identity). The child will need to take some painkiller medications like syrup Crocin DS (250 mg/5 ml), 2.5 ml thrice a day for 3 to 5 days to reduce the pain. As regarding the cream, it is good, please continue using it. Unfortunately, I will not be able to judge from the picture if the child needs Bactigrass application or no to the burn site. This can only be assessed by a surgeon. Hence, it is advisable to get the child physically evaluated by a surgeon as early as possible. If required, the surgeon will clean up the wound and debride or leave the skin as it is and can assess if the child needs Bactigrass sheet application or no."

Q. I have constant twitches in my upper arm. Could it be an early sign of ALS?,"Hi doctor, I am a 38 year old male, and I have been feeling twitches in my arm. I started feeling this constant twitch about six weeks ago. I did not experience any weakness in that arm or anywhere else in the body. The twitches lasted for about a week and then went away. The twitches have now appeared four weeks later in the same area (upper arm). Again, there is no apparent weakness, which I have tested by lifting weights at the gym and both my upper and lower body strength seems to be fine. What is worrying me to death is, could these twitches be an early sign of ALS? Is it possible that weakness will follow even though I do not have it now? Do ALS twitches go away for four weeks at a time and reappear? If I started to experience constant twitches six weeks ago, if this was ALS should not I have experienced some weakness by now? Is the fact that the twitches are localized to the same place a bad thing?","Hello. I have read your query and understand your concerns. First of all, I will suggest you consider other possibilities before jumping to conclusions. There are a number of conditions which can present with twitches without any disease, and ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) is one of the remotest possibility for a 38 year old young male. The commonest cause for twitches is simple worry or anxiety. I know at least 100 individuals with anxiety, who presented with simple twitches and no other symptoms. In my opinion, you need to see whether these twitches have any relationship with your anxiety level. The another common conditions which present with twitches is endocrine abnormalities, such as thyroid and parathyroid disorders. In case the stress level is not able to explain the twitches, an evaluation for endocrine abnormality is indicated. The list may go on in a similar fashion.

Her last menstrual period was in the last week, two months back. The local gynecologist told it is because of gas and gave an antibiotic tablet, multivitamin syrup and gas related tablet. The following day, early morning she felt headache and a body ache.Â Is it something to be worried about? Is she pregnant?Â When do the earliest symptoms of pregnancy come up?","Hello. These are not pregnancy symptoms, but rather they are symptoms of ovulation with mild abdominal ache, nausea, headache, bloating and thin mucus discharge from vagina. As her last menstrual period (LMP) was in the last week, two months back. So, it is day16 today. Hence in a 30 day cycle, this is the time for ovulation. As you had sex in the first week the following month, still she can be considered in her fertile period and hence an emergency contraceptive is advisable to be taken in 72 hours in your case to prevent pregnancy. However, the earliest you can detect pregnancy would be after 7 days post-intercourse with a serum beta-hCG test. If it shows the level of hCG more than 5 ng/dL then shall confirm pregnancy.

Q. Will Kalarchikai cure multiple ovarian cysts in PCOD?,"Hello doctor, I have multiple small cysts in both ovaries (PCOS). Our family friend suggested me to consume Kalarchikai medicine, powdered mixed with pepper and honey to have it for one mandalam (48 days).

I masturbate every day in the morning before bath on my bed with the stomach position.   I have never masturbated with tool in hand position and I have even tried but I am not able to. I cannot ejaculate in that manner.   The moment I lay down on stomach, I ejaculate in less than 20 seconds. I am very worried.   My masturbation has become even more regular since I am unable to have sex with my wife.   Also my wife is very sensitive when I touch her vagina.

Q. My right eye is red and puffy after wearing contact lenses under light. Why?,"Hello doctor,My right eye is red and puffy. It hurts when I blink by the top of my iris.

When it started, it only hurt when I blinked, and the eye would tear up a bit, the next day it was red, puffy and it reacted to light. I immediately removed the contact lenses. What is wrong with my right eye?","Hello. First of all, I would like to tell you my point of view as an ophthalmologist in and against any contact lens that stays in the eye for more than 12 hours. The puffiness is most probably related to an allergic reaction that your eyes are experiencing, and you should discontinue using these contacts. The redness, the light sensitivity, and even the tearing are all signs of dry eye for which you should start using artificial tears at least four to six times daily, especially if you plan on using contact lenses again. Regardless of what any manufacturer says, you should not sleep with your contact lenses, and I would advise you to use daily from now on. You can use artificial tears while wearing glasses."
Q. What can be done for stammer in children?,"Hello doctor, My daughter has started to stammer. What should I do?","Hello. Stammering or stuttering is not very uncommon in this age group. Most children do stammer at this age, and with time over a few months, it gets resolved usually. I believe that the delivery of this child was smooth, and she had no history of admissions for any illness. Also, her milestones are normal and not delayed. Now here, the family has to play an important role. Your child has started developing speech, and this is quite normal to happen. So, first of all, you stop worrying. And even if you worry because I know it can be alarming for parents, please do not pass on your anxiety to your kid. Just do not let her feel that it is abnormal. Whenever she speaks, to listen to her and never try to correct her or scold her for this. Pay attention to what she is saying and look at her, and eye contact should be there. When you talk to her, talk slowly so that she can grasp every word. Kids always try to imitate us. She will also start speaking slowly, which will help her say words correctly and with ease. Never criticize or scold, also tell everyone at your home and even school teachers. Encourage her to speak. Do not pass your anxiety to your kid is most important because if a child gets anxious, it will get more pronounced. Slowly and gradually, you will see that your kid has outgrown this. If still, you feel that there is no improvement after one to two months, speech therapy may be done. Speech therapy should be started before four to five years. I hope this advice would be helpful to you. I would be there for any help."

Q. I have become extremely anxious after electric shock. Why?,"Hello doctor, I am 17 years old and mostly healthy. I had an EEG and an MRI several months back; both came back fine. I suffer from OCD related tension headaches. On the 15th, I was in my father's office looking for something. It was too dark and so I decided to turn on my dad's lamp. It is an archaic thing, built in the 1930's by my grandfather's sister and it is mostly copper. I grasped for the light switch, instead I accidentally touched the copper beam of the lamp. The moment I touched it my hand gripped it. Around four to five seconds passed till I realized that my hand was shaking and got an electric shock. I quickly pulled away. Then, I felt sick, extremely anxious and in a daze. The next morning, I woke up extremely anxious and a tad bit confused. I felt as if I was confused. My parents brushed it off as anxiety and stress. Later that day, I had what seemed to be an allergic reaction to my lunch. I had red blotches all over my chest and neck. My face felt hot. Then, I received a 50 mg Benadryl shot. Almost instantly I felt as if the space around me shifted. I felt taller soon after I got tired, confused and disorientated. By the time I got into the car, I fell asleep, although I was not really asleep. I felt like I was slipping in and out of consciousness the entire way home. It was as if half of my brain had shut off. My muscles were limp and I was thinking strange things as if my mind was thinking by itself and I had no control on it. I then managed to walk into my room without falling and sleep. It was a dreamless sleep. When I woke up, I was irritated. Every voice in the house made me angry and I ended up cursing my brother and mom. I engaged in short nonsense conversations on and off. I would talk about something that did not make any sense and then I forget and ask what I was talking about. My head and neck vibrated. My muscles were weak and my body felt jittery. I wanted to sleep, but I could not. The space around me was fluctuating. Then, I had a large panic attack that lasted till 12 AM and I woke up the next morning around 10 AM with severe confusion and deorientation. I was thinking nonsense and could not construct a sentence. My muscles were weak again and I could not focus on reality and my head was vibrating. Fear sets in again. I do not cry even when terrible things happen as I usually cope, but I could not control my mind and cried a lot. We called the doctor who gave the injection. He told me that I was having some kind of allergic reaction and that I should take Zantac to help the Benadryl move through my system. Later in the day, it seemed to dissipate slightly. But, now (7 PM) it is back and almost as bad as it was this morning. I took another Zantac, but it has not done anything yet. I feel the vibrations most in my teeth and nose. Also, I have a rapid heartbeat. Is this being caused by the electric shock? And if so, will it go away over time? Am I in long term issue? Or is this caused by the Benadryl? It has been over 30 hours and I believe it is only since I was injected. Did this trigger long-term side effects? Do stress headaches have anything with this? Or is this caused by a combination of all three things? I just need help. Please I need to know what is going on. I really do not want to live with this. I am having a very hard time writing this. Thank you so much for your time. Also, my dad got shocked three times by that lamp.",Hi. I understand your symptoms with chronological order. For further information consult a neurologist online -->

Q. My testicles start hurting after erection without orgasm. Why?,"Hello doctor, After every erection without orgasm, my testicles start hurting along with abdominal pain. Kindly advice.","Hello. Testicular pain after erection may be a signal that you are having epidydymo orchitis because the epididymis and testicles are the organs where your sperms are stored and produced respectively. So if the pain comes when there is a history of trying to ejaculate that may suggest inflammation somewhere in these organs was there a previous history of STI (sexually transmitted disease) before this incident, pain from the testes is usually referred to the lower abdomen. We also need to be mindful of testicular torsion.I advise you to do urine MCS (microscopy, culture, and sensitivity), semen analysis MCS then scrotal scan to see the testicles anatomically for any scarification."

As far as cost is concern, you can get some other way, like hospital cost is very inflated, get it administered at a small center, you can get injections from wholesale yourself, and you can go for generic drug."
Q. Kindly help me to clarify that my period is normal or is it due to the side effect of I-pill.,"Hello doctor, Last month I had I-pill (within 48hours of intercourse) after 18 days of onset of my periods. I did not have any side effects like withdrawal bleeding, nausea, etc., after taking the I-pill. I got my periods on the 1st of this month. I am unsure if this is my normal period or bleeding due to the side effect of I-pill? Please help me to clarify this. If it is my regular periods, then there is no delay in it (a week before or week after than expected date). Is it normal? Is there a need to take a test or any chances of pregnancy? If yes, when to take the test?","Hello. Let me start by assuring you that you are not pregnant and need not worry. If you have had your periods 18 days before taking I-pill, your ovulation would have been around 13 to 15 days after that. Life of egg is only one day. So there is no chance of an egg being alive on that day of sex. I-pill or emergency contraception pill is a high dose of progesterone hormone. After ovulation, your ovary also will be producing the same hormone. As you have taken it after the ovulation date, the thickness of the inner uterine lining would have increased further. But would not have shed. Usually, if you take it before ovulation, your bleeding will start within a few days. So you should have had your regular periods, slightly thicker or more than usual. If you had bleeding almost like regular periods, then the inner lining of the uterus has been shed. There is no chance of pregnancy if at all, to catch inside the uterus. So do not worry, your next period will be one month from this period. I hope I have clarified your query, do write back if any more questions and for your feedback."

Q. Will Kalarchikai cure multiple ovarian cysts in PCOD?,"Hello doctor, I have multiple small cysts in both ovaries (PCOS). Our family friend suggested me to consume Kalarchikai medicine, powdered mixed with pepper and honey to have it for one mandalam (48 days). I have completed nearly 44 days by consuming one small ball of the mixture every morning and before two weeks I got my periods. Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged. Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well.","Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally. Medicine is not of much help."

Q. Can stopping Sizodon LS suddenly cause any problem?,"Hello doctor, Since four years I am taking Sizodon LS medicine from a trusted doctor. Nowadays I feel sufficient response. But after consulting my same doctor, he is avoiding to stop that medicine. As per his opinion, if I stop this tablet, again I will face problem after a month. Now, I request you, is it true or false?","Hi. As you are on Sizodon LS (Risperidone) for last four years and now alright. Stopping the drugs depends upon many factors like your diagnosis, family support, etc. It is true that if you are suffering from schizophrenia or related diseases, then it is advised that you continue the medicine for many years or possibly life long otherwise relapse (symptoms re-appear) can occur. So, continue your treatment according to the advise of your psychiatrist."
Q. Does sharp pain in lower left abdomen in pregnant woman mean labor?,"Hello doctor, I am 37 weeks pregnant. I have sharp pain in lower left side that is coming every couple minutes but does not last long. Is this the start of labor? I am also possibly leaking amniotic fluid but I am not entirely sure since there is not a lot.","Hi. How are you doing today? As you said most probably it is the beginning of labor pain. Usually cervix, the mouth of uterus is slightly to the left. Pain usually lasts for a few seconds only, but reappears. Do not worry. Minimal vaginal discharge with this pain indicates that cervix is gradually opening. To confirm about the pain, just feel the top of uterus, trying to indent your fingers. When no pain, you can feel the baby parts. When you get the pain, uterus contracts and becomes stony hard, you will not feel baby parts. Just having pain is not an emergency.  Just note four points:  1. Movement- you should have atleast four movements after each meal. 2. Pain- if it is frequent and lasts longer. 3. Leak- you will feel thick water just wetting your clothes. Not minimal discharge. 4. Bleeding- obvious red colour.  You will need medical help in all these situations. Do not panic, if this is your first pregnancy, it takes about 12 hours for baby to come out after true labor pain and 6 to 8 hours, if second. All the best."
Q. Are rashes on penis due to sexually transmitted disease?,"Hello doctor, For the past two months, I have been experiencing a minor rash on the crown of my penis. I have have been using antibacterial cream since then but it does not seem to recover. The rash occurred a month after I had an unprotected sex. No itch, no discharge, no pain while urinating or anything just a few rashes that do not seem to go away. Could this be a sign of STDs? No other symptoms are present. I also had an HIV test a month after I had sex and it was non-reactive but I have a very high cholesterol level. Could you please tell me what is going on? I use Brulidine cream (antiseptic and antibacterial cream).","Hi. I saw your clinical pictures (attachment removed to protect patient identity), genitals look normal clinically, skin is little dry, I do not see any rash, blister or ulcer which are the manifestation of STD. In the first picture, those white tiny bumps below the glans (tip of the penis) are the harmless ones, they are called pearly penile papules. Are you referring to them? Herpes will have painful blisters in a group with redness at the base. Syphilis, chancroid will have ulcers. Gonorrhea presents with pus from the urethra, pain while urinating. At present, with your history and clinical pictures, I do not see any symptoms or signs of any STD."
Q. I had spica cast. When can I start driving or riding a motorcycle?,"Hello doctor,I had a road accident and fractured my right thumb. It happened three weeks back and was administered a spica cast the next day of injury. After an X-ray, the doctor suggested that the cast can be removed in a few days. I want to understand, how long before I can resume my normal activities like driving or riding a motorcycle, etc. Also, I was strength training regularly before the accident, when is it advisable to lift heavy weights again?","Hello. It is a bony mallet injury. You need to wear the splint on for eight weeks totally, a mallet thumb splint. Do not remove the splint for eight weeks. Repeat X-rays after eight weeks of injury and splint application. And then after eight weeks, you will require physiotherapy for mobilization as you are expected to have the stiffness of that joint. Driving can be about three months after the date of injury. Heavy weight lifting can be done after six months of the date of injury. Can you send me the other view of the X-ray also, if you have so that I can see the fracture better in the other view of X-ray also?

Q. My CBC showed 1+ anisocytosis. Any suggestions?,"Hello doctor,My recent CBC showed 1+ anisocytosis and 1+ anisocytosis. My hemoglobin is 12.9. The lowest hemoglobin I ever had was I believe post my C-section. I do take multivitamin/ or prenatal almost on daily basis even now. I am concerned with these results: I know in previous blood test it showed some anisocytosis but not +1. My physician did not say anything about this. I found out because I read my tests. I am going back to see him and question these results. Any suggestions?",Hello. Anisocytosis means a difference in the size of the red blood cells. This could mean that you have a mild iron deficiency. Anisocytosis of 1+ is a very mild variation in the size of the RBCs. Your hemoglobin levels are towards the lower end of the normal range and it is possible that your iron stores are depleted. This can be determined by testing serum ferritin levels. I would suggest that you continue taking the iron and folic acid tablets for another two to three months to bring up your hemoglobin levels and replenish your iron stores. There is no need for you to worry. For more information consult a hematologist online -->

This often happens when a stressful situation arises, which also raises my BP. Worries related to health and other life concerns keep bothering me. Please suggest.","Hello. From your symptoms, it seems like fibromyalgia with anxiety. Whenever we are anxious, our autonomic nervous system plays a role, and hence increases the blood flow to various organs by pumping more blood at higher rates, and thus heartbeats can be felt by us. Also, when we are subjected to constant stress, those muscles become stiff. And thus, due to constant tension in them, they hurt after some time because of lactic acid accumulation. Your BP (blood pressure) is also because of stress and not medical hypertension. I would like to know more about your symptoms. Let me know about the details so that I can help you further.

Q. Are cough and chest congestion the symptoms of pneumonia?,"Hello doctor,I am having cough and chest congestion for the last three days. Also getting a mild fever again and again. I also have a chest X-ray done today only. Please suggest is it pneumonia and if yes how severe is it?","Hello. Your chest x-ray appears normal. There is no pneumonia. What you have is an upper respiratory tract infection (URTI), mostly caused by viruses. This is a self-limited disease and usually clears up within seven days on its own. Sometimes, cough can persist a while longer and is called post-viral cough. Antibiotics are useless against viruses. They should only be used against bacterial infections. Viruses cause the vast majority of URTIs. These infections spread through the air (when you cough or sneeze) or through contact. They are not transmitted through food. Treatment for viral URTI is symptomatic. Fever medicines like Paracetamol, Ibuprofen, or Naproxen can be used. Nasal decongestants for the congested nose. If cough persists beyond a week, then a corticosteroid inhaler can help."

I have started to worry, sometimes I almost reach but never totally reached, and sometimes I return without an orgasm. Is it because of my porn history? I do not know where the problem is?","Hello. Orgasm is not traceable to your masturbation or porn history. Some people experience it a few times in their sex life. Even in a heterosexual relationship, most times the man cums even when the lady is yet to cum. On many occasion, she never cums. So it is body differences.

Q. Is it mandatory to remove the premolars for my orthodontic treatment?,"Hello doctor,Yesterday I consulted an orthodontist, and I was told, that to keep the changes that braces will acquire, they will have to pull out four of my healthy teeth, without including the wisdom teeth. Those are going to be four premorals, two on the upper jaw, and two on the bottom jaw. I heard that it is the only way because of my severe jaw defect. I was wondering if it can be true because nobody wants to get rid of healthy teeth.","Hello. I can tell you about treatment in the broader sense. In case of the shorter lower jaw, either a surgical and orthodontic treatment is done (in case of poor esthetics, both jaws and teeth are corrected) or orthodontic correction of only teeth. Since your question is about the second treatment plan and pertains to extractions I will answer that. Extractions are relatively common in orthodontic treatment to create space. In cases with smaller lower jaws with space requirement, upper arch extractions are mandatory. Lower arch extractions are also advised if there is space requirement or extractions needed for bite improvement or maintenance of normal bite. So it is reasonable to advise the extraction of four teeth. You can send pictures of your teeth and X-rays to confirm whether this fits your case."
Q. Can you please review my blood test reports?,"Hello ! Can you please review my blood test? My concern are low level of ferritin, high level of B12 and Urine WBC is very high.","Hi, Welcome to the icliniq Following is my opinion for your asked question. The low ferritn , Low Mcv could be suggestive of early iron deficiency anemia. The common cause for high B12 include supplement intake , Liver disease or Kidney disease. Your liver & kidney profile reports are normal.So don't worry about that. If you have any history of supplement intake than mention it.B12 excreted by urine , so might need not to worry about that.High Non Veg food also sometime can cause elevated B12. For low ferritin no need of any treatment.Repeat your serum ferritin & serum iron after few days. The WBC in urine could be due to urinary tract infection.For that investigate further with urine culture report.Meanwhile take more water & cranberry juice extract tablet.Attach the urine culture report once done. Hope this will help you Regards"

Q. I had vibration in my chest associated with shoulder pain. What does it indicate?,"Hello doctor,I am 27 years old, weighing 57.1 kg and about 1.45 in length. I was busy cleaning this morning when my heartbeat felt very strange. Like it was vibrating inside my chest, it lasted for about 30 seconds and stopped. After that, I feel very tired, a little out of breath, and a heavy weight on my shoulders. Should I be concerned?","Hello. You probably had a transient arrhythmia (abnormal heart rhythm). The most common type of abnormal heart rhythm at your age (assuming you do not have any pre-existing heart conditions) is supraventricular tachycardia. This can produce symptoms like palpitations, lightheadedness, and a strange feeling in the chest. An ECG, if done during the actual episode, can provide a diagnosis. But at least, you should get a baseline ECG. So, I suggest seeing your general physician within the next few days. Other things that are pertinent when you have fast heart rhythms are: 1. Excess production of thyroid hormone (a thyroid test TSH would be appropriate).2. Excessive consumption of caffeine.3. Any recreational drug use like cocaine.4. Electrolyte imbalance.If you get these episodes frequently, you should see a cardiologist who can order some tests."
"Q. Will Zoloft cause muscle pain, cramps or tingling?","Hello doctor, Do Zoloft cause muscle pain and cramps or tingling?","Hello. Yes, Zoloft (Sertraline) may cause muscle cramps, tingling by disturbing blood sodium chloride levels. Zoloft is an SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor), which may cause a disturbance in these ions (sodium and chloride) hence may cause it. Get the blood test done serum sodium and serum chloride, or you may try increasing salt intake in your diet. Which if improves your problem then it is undoubtedly due to low sodium and chloride."
"Q. What can be done for bloating in a patient with acidity, GERD and IBS?","Hi doctor, I am suffering from acidity, GERD, IBS from the last five years.

Sometimes breathlessness, pressure in eyes and head. I have fat in my stomach around 2 to 3 inches. I have visited many gastroenterologist but no result.","Hello. You have several symptoms related to the gastrointestinal tract: 1. GERD.  2. Irritable bowels.  3. Bloating.  You also seem to have abdominal obesity and high blood pressure. Proton pump inhibitors like Pantoprazole and Rabeprazole do not seem to have helped you. I suggest a dietary approach that will reduce your weight and also can get rid of the bloating, acid reflux and irritable bowel symptoms. That diet is the low carbohydrate, high fat diet (LCHF diet) or ketogenic diet. This involves cutting down your carbohydrate intake and increasing the intake of healthy fats. In my experience, nearly all people who followed this diet got rid of the acid reflux and bloating. The good thing is, you can also lose weight and possibly reverse your high blood pressure."
Q. A vein is blocked in heart and there is chest pain while walking far. What has to be done?,"Hello doctor, A vein is blocked near the heart. The doctor told that he checked up today and there is a pain in the chest when he walks far. He is 45 years old, what should be done?","Hi. Blocked artery in the heart causes pain especially when one is engaged in activities like walking due to increased heart rate during activity which reduces blood supply to the heart muscles leading to ischemia and pain. This condition is called angina pectoris. It is a problem with the coronary arteries which supplies the heart muscle. The doctor to see is the cardiologist. Do ECG, do clotting time. Take Isorsobide Dinitrate 5 mg three times daily will help to open the heart arteries and relieve the pain. Take care."

Beginning of acute upper respiratory tract infection, in case you show other signs including runny nose, cough, sore throat or others of cold and flu symptoms. 2. Frontal headache can be due to paranasal sinus inflammation which is part of cold and flu symptoms or part of long-term inflammation. 3. Stress, lack of sleep, anxiety or bad mood. 4. Bad sleeping position (for the neck) or uncomfortable pillow (usually comes in the morning and back of neck and head but can be in the front as well). 5.

Q. The nevus on my lacrimal caruncle shows some difference. Is it melanoma?,"Hello doctor, I have a nevus on my lacrimal caruncle which has been there for almost 10 years. Recently I have noticed a slight change in it. Could it be melanoma?","Hello. I understand your concern, but I would not advise you to jump into any hasty conclusions. First of all, birthmarks, moles are very common even with the localization that you mentioned. However, to advise you better, it is preferable to compare this lesion on photos taken during these last few years as a marker, keeping in mind that humans undergo many changes as they age. Second of all, it is more advisable to get digital images of this lesion captured by an optometrist or an ophthalmologist through a slit lamp and under magnification for better evaluation. Thirdly, if an ophthalmologist has confirmed your suspicion, a biopsy can be taken from it and sent to histopathology in the assessment at a cellular level, which will clear all doubts completely."
Q. Is it normal to have raised WBC count in teenager?,"Hello doctor, My 16 years old son had a routine CBC performed as part of his physical for summer camp. His white blood count came back low 3.4 thousand/uL (reference 4.5 to 13.0), absolute neutrophils 1445 cells/uL (reference 1800 to 8000), neutrophils 42.5 %. He has always been very healthy and has not had any recent illnesses or infections. The other numbers were within normal range. The doctor wants to retest the blood in three months. Why wait so long? Knowing that some of the causes of a low white count are serious makes me want to retest sooner. What do you advise?",Hello. The neutrophil in children usually can be due to some temporary infection etiology. Viral infection also can cause neutropenia due to relatively high lymphocytes. I suggest to repeat CBC and peripheral smear examination report again after 10 to 15 days. I am also not in favour of repeating CBC after three months.

Should I start taking the same medicine Olanzapine? As I do not want to go to for check-up any more.","Hello. Psychosis should not be taken lightly because psychosis is a term that reflects a variety of explanation like it may be schizophrenia, it may be due to depression, may be secondary to alcohol or any other condition, so diagnosis is very important, that your primary doctor knows better. And every diagnosis has a different course of treatment, as for as you alcohol is a concern that blackout means you should be more concern and should be adequately treated.

Q. What can I do to get rid of tapeworms?,"Hello doctor, I suspect I may have tapeworms. How can I be sure and what can I do to get rid of them?","Hello. Stool tests can identify tapeworm infestation. However, because the worms and eggs are shed intermittently, the test may have to be repeated three to four times if the initial test is negative. Stool tests can also identify other intestinal parasites. Blood tests (serological tests) are also available, including ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) and PCR (polymerase chain reaction). Praziquantel is the drug that is used to treat tapeworm infestations."

Could you help me because I am desperate?","Hello. I can appreciate your dilemma. I will suggest discussing your concerns with your psychiatrist. Write down all the reasons why you think you may have bipolar disorder and discuss it with your psychiatrist during your next review. Screening tests in the search may give approximate guidance, but they not very specific. For example, many teenagers have significant mood swings, which may inadvertently be flagged up as bipolar.

Q. What would be the reason for development of large number of moles?,"Hello doctor, My wife is 25 years old. She has been developing lot of moles on her body especially on hands and face. Initially they are very light almost like a small brown spot, but gradually they are becoming darker. They are incrementing periodically. What would be the reason for it? Is there any medication for it to stop and eradicate the issue? Thank you.","Hi. As you explained the disease that your wife has multiple small moles over face and hands, it certainly indicates solar lentigines. It is a multiple freckles type mole due to sun exposure. Now, let me explain the treatment and precautions. Avoid exposure to sunlight as much as you can. Cover body with clothes and cap while going out. Use sunscreen over face and hand every four hourly till evening. This will prevent further development of disease. Now to treat existing lentigines we can opt for laser. Creams will not be of much helpful in this. Q-switched Nd:YAG laser (neodymium-doped yttrium aluminium garnet) will be very useful. You can consult a doctor around you for this laser. One or two sitting would be enough to remove it completely. There is no side effect. It could be costlier, but results are good."

Q. Why does urine appear dark brown inspite of having Fluconazole?,"Hello doctor, I was initially diagnosed with a urinary tract infection by the presence of white blood cells in my urine. I had symptoms of a typical UTI. I was given a five days course of antibiotics, but the symptoms did not go away, followed by 2*5 days more courses of antibiotics. A urine culture was done after three types of antibiotics failure.

I drink a lot of water, and I am HIV negative, I tested negative for prostate cancer, and I am 27 years old. Please help.

I would suggest you complete two weeks of Fluconazole but no other antibiotics."

"Q. After using larger size silicone ring to loose the foreskin, I experience pain. Why?","Hi doctor, I am a 30-year-old male. I am currently using phimocure silicone rings to loosen up my foreskin. Yesterday afternoon I accidentally used a large ring 26 mm by wearing it for 1 hour 30 minutes. After taking off the ring, I have this persistent pain like burning and pressure on the tip of the foreskin (majority on the left side). I still have this pain and wanted to know if it will go away by itself? I am also using Betamethasone cream.","Hello. I have gone through your queries. The only solution to phimosis is circumcision. However, you may have minor vascular injury inside the foreskin due to the use of a tight silicon ring. You can wait and watch to buy some time for natural regression of the swelling or else you can straightway go for circumcision after consulting your local urologist. By few days to weeks, the swelling will reduce. But the permanent solution of phimosis is circumcision."
Q. Ears feel clogged while in a closed room. Why?,"Hello doctor, Why do our ears feel full or clogged when we are in a closed room? Are these because of air pressure and ambient noise?","Hello. Rather than a closed or open room, this is related to outside and inside ear pressure. There is an air cavity in our ear called a middle ear, and there is a membrane which separates this cavity from the external environment called a tympanic layer. So, there is air on either side of the tympanic membrane. So, when pressure on either side if high, then the membrane gets fixed and cannot move properly, giving the feeling of a clogged ear. And there is a connection between the middle ear cavity and our throat which equalizes pressure within the ear cavity and outside environment. So, whenever one gets an infection, then this tube blocked and there occurs a mismatch of pressure leading to clogged ear. And also swallowing movements opens this tube temporarily, which helps in equalizing the pressure leading to relief. Similar things occur when one travels in an airplane. So pressure changes are decisive in this. I hope this helps you and get back if you have any doubts."
Q. I have a red dot on my penis head. Could it be herpes?,"HelloÂ doctor, I had a UTI two years ago that went untreated which resulted in the problem.

I have been using Kermatazole on the penis head for over a year now when the redness gets brighter. I take comprehensive STD tests every four months. The readings are always the same and the results negative. Now, I am worried that I have tested as an early case of herpes II simplex (genital herpes). I have performed two HSV2 IGG quant tests this year. Four months ago, I tested with a reading of 0.076. This month, I tested with a reading of 0.232. I had several different sexual partners during this period with unprotected contact, but no unprotected penetration, including two days before the most recent test. Should I be worried I contracted genital herpes?",Hello. I understand that you are greatly concerned about having early genital herpes. For more information consult a general practitioner online -->
Q. Please explain the diagnosis of MRI result.,"Hello doctor, I would like to know the diagnosis of this MRI result. Multiplanar and multisequential MRI of the brain without intravenous contrast administration was taken. Single voxel MR spectroscopy through the basal ganglia was also performed. The brain parenchyma demonstrates interval development of diffuse cerebral volume loss, most prominently involving the cortex, with a widening of the sulci and ex-vacuo dilatation of the ventricular system. There is a faint T2-FLAIR hyperintense signal of the bilateral hemispheric white matter. There is sparing of the cerebellum and only mild interval thinning of the corpus callosum. Interval development of a subdural collection along the left cerebral convexity, most prominent at the left frontal convexity causing a mild mass effect on the left frontal parenchyma. It shows mildly increased FLAIR signal, likely related to proteinaceous content. The intraorbital optic nerves have decreased volume, compatible with optic atrophy. There are punctate foci of susceptibility artifact in the right parietal and right occipital region, likely related to minimal hemosiderin staining. No mass lesion or midline shift. There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage or acute territorial infarction. No hydrocephalus. No cerebellar tonsillar herniation. Preserved flow voids of the major intracranial vessels. There are bilateral mastoid and middle ear effusions and mucosal disease of the bilateral paranasal sinuses. Single voxel MRI spectroscopy at the basal ganglia demonstrates increased choline and mildly decreased NAA, nonspecific markers of parenchymal injury. Impression:  Interval development of severe supratentorial brain volume loss with thinning of the intraorbital optic nerves. Interval development of a subdural collection along the left cerebral convexity with mild mass effect on the left frontal lobe.","Hello. I read carefully and reviewed the patient MRI report (attachment removed to protect patient identity) and would explain that it shows a progressive brain atrophy (brain cell death) and small ischemic strokes, which could cause progressive dementia. These changes are probably related to small vessel disease of the brain (chronic changes in small brain vessels caused by uncontrolled diabetes, dyslipidemia, hypertension, smoking, etc.). There is also a subdural collection, which is causing mild compression on the left frontal lobe. I would recommend consulting with a neurosurgeon about this. I would also recommend to closely monitor his blood pressure values, periodically check his fasting glucose and blood lipid profile. If dementia is present (memory troubles, confusion), I would recommend treatment with Donepezil or Memantine. Hope to have been helpful. For more information consult a neurologist online -->"

I am not sure what it is but wanted to let you know should you have come across a similar situation with one of your patients. Please reply.","Hello. Well, most of our patients initially complain to us about very vague symptoms at onset, just like yours. But we explore the possibility based on some more information and yes, of course, investigating them thoroughly. The pain you mention which made you still and shaky, can be arising from the gut as in abdominal colic (a sudden wave of spasm in muscles within the gut). Or can be arising from endometriosis which is anther problem of the female genital tract, whereby there is excessive growth of normal uterus tissues in the lower part of the belly. Thirdly, it can simply be due to perimenstrual syndrome which is pain occurring at the time of menses. For now, I suggest you to do some test and ultrasound abdomen and pelvis, later we can discuss the findings of your result. Functional abdominal colic. Perimenstrual syndrome. Endometriosis. Complete blood count. TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone), FT3. Liver function tests. Stool detail report. Urine detail report. US (ultrasound) abdomen and pelvis.

"Q. While extraction, I was told that my tooth was attached to bone. Is it common?","Hi doctor, During a recent extraction of 9 teeth, the dentist said that my right upper back molar had attached itself to the bone. When he tried to extract it a piece of my jaw bone cracked off, pierced the sinus cavity and punctured an artery. Blood spurted everywhere and they frantically applied pressure and packing until it stopped. They sutured it and sent me home with Penicillin.

Q. Need second opinion on Celexa and Buspar for severe anxiety/panic attacks,"Dear Doctor, I am a 24 year old female, was prescribed withÂ Celexa 20mg Â once daily andÂ Buspar 5mg twice daily for severe anxiety/panic attacks. Both of these medicines are SSRIs though, and I read about it online that everyone/every source says never to take them at the same time due to risk of serotonin syndrome. Today, after taking the Buspar, I felt cold and shivered constantly. I could not get warm and I was very sleepy. Now I am scared to take the night time dose of Buspar and Celexa. I would like to have a second opinion on the safety of taking these medications together. If it is not safe, can I take only one instead? Which one would you recommend, the Buspar or the Celexa? Thank you in advance.","Hi. You are not on too high a dose of celexa or buspar. However serotonin syndrome is not always dose dependant. I feel just the chills and sedation are too general to be indicative of serotonin syndrome. You should have some level of muscle rigidity, high fever, muscular contractions (myoclonus) to suggest that. In my professional opinion I do not have much faith in Buspar.  Celexa is good enough as an antidepressant (SSRI) to eventually help you have a full remission of depression, anxiety and panic attacks. If I was your treating psychiatrist, I would have supplemented the celexa with clonazepam (Klonopin) on a as needed basis, between 0.5 and 1mg every 8 hours PRN anxiety. If you are feeling cold and shivering constantly you might need to see your PCP (Primary Care Physician) to urgently address if you have an active urinary tract infection and also have him check your thyroid function. In effect, I advise you to stop the Buspar for now. Hope it helps. Get back to a psychiatrist online for further help -->"
Q. I do not feel any sensation in my penis at the time of sex. Does masturbation cause this numbness?,"Hello Doctor I am a 30 year old male, married for 2 years. I do not smoke or drink. There is no medical history. My penis is circumcised from childhood. The problem which I am facing is that I do not feel any sensation in my penis glans at the time of sex or while masturbating.In normal state, my penis is dry. I use lubricants while having sex. But still the penis remains numb. Only a few seconds before ejaculation I feel the sensation in my penis. I started masturbating 10 years back. Is this a reason for this numbness? I do not have any erectile dysfunction. But still I am not able to enjoy sex due to this problem. Is there any medication to enhance sensation? Please help me overcome this problem.",Hello. I read your query and understand your concerns. Having less or no sensation in penis while having sex is generally due to local factors. The systemic illnesses rarely affect in this way. Masturbation is normal and it does not have any adverse effects either on sensation or erection. So it is time to realize that the sensation problem is not due to chronic masturbation. The possible reason as per available history is dryness of penis which makes the nerve endings non-functional over a course of time. To counter this problem it is essential to use oil based soap (rather than traditional soap) and skin moisturizer which prevent the dryness of skin of glans penis. It can be said that you can use any branded moisturizer for application to penis and local area after taking bath every day. During love making session I advise you to use Durex real feel which is available across the globe for increasing sensation and making the sex more pleasurable. Unfortunately there are no medicines for this purpose and lubricants which I have mentioned above will be helpful to a large extent. Revert back to a sexologist online for further follow up -->

Q. The stretch marks on my inner thighs hurt. Please help.,"Hello doctor, I have stretch marks on my inner thighs and buttocks area. When I sit for about 30 minutes, the stretch marks hurt (in the scale of 1-10, the pain is around 8). So, I have to stand up once in a while. More and more stretch marks appear when they hurt and they hurt too. It is very uncomfortable, and it already affects my work (programmer) where I have to sit all the time. I have visited 4 dermatologists already, and one of them even said that stretch marks are not painful, maybe it is varicose veins. I already tried laser, derma roller, pain reliever, retin A, collagen cream and cocoa butter (but they did not work) as per doctors advise. This all started when I started gaining weight/muscle a few years ago. I already stopped going to the gym and all my supplements about a month ago, but the pain is still there.","Hi.I have gone through your history and picture (attachment removed to protect patient identity). I get your worry. I can see that you have already tried a lot of therapies for the same with not much relief. Weight gain is usually a gradual process and not much skin stretch pain is experienced. But few nerve endings become exposed to the exterior in the stretched skin. When weight loss occurs, stretched skin hangs back loose. But it is still not back to normal skin. It is still thin and exposing your sensitive nerves when you stretch, like when you sit or squat. This is why you get that pain sensation during such activity.Now having considered that you have tried most of the options, I would suggest you try a few additional measures that can help."
Q. I have tiny hard black spot on penis with no harm and it does not go away. What could it be?,"Hello doctor, I have a tiny hard spot on the head of my penis. It does not bother me unless I mess with it. It has been there for many many years, but just recently I have noticed a bit of pain when I am just sitting around. It is probably the size of a pinhead and it is dark in color. I have not had a sexual partner in a very long time (years). It does not seem like a boil or a pimple. The very top of the spot is black. Please suggest.","Hello. I can understand your concern. According to your statement, you have been suffering from a tiny hard spot on the head of the penis. This type of tiny spot can result from various reasons such as mole produced from over secretion of melanin by skin cells. They are harmless and nothing to be worried. Penile papule appears around the penis head which does not itch or produce any fluid. They may disappear as time passes. Angiokeratoma is a tiny red bump that appears when blood vessels near your penile skin become dilated. They are rough in nature and may become thicker over time. Lymphocele has resulted from blockage in the lymph channel near your penile head. It does not need any treatment and dissolves over time. Peyronie's disease is resulted from scar tissue which is found on the top of the penis that tends to harden due to calcium deposition. Treatment is needed when it makes erection of the penis difficult. Again your penile tiny hard spot may be resulted from a pimple, cyst, or STD (sexually transmitted disease). As your penile spot does not create any difficulty in your regular performance so it is nothing to be worried and needs no treatment. I think it will disappear over time. You can undergo FNAC (fine needle aspiration cytology) or biopsy from a tiny hard spot on the top of your penile head."

Q. Will Kalarchikai cure multiple ovarian cysts in PCOD?,"Hello doctor, I have multiple small cysts in both ovaries (PCOS). Our family friend suggested me to consume Kalarchikai medicine, powdered mixed with pepper and honey to have it for one mandalam (48 days). I have completed nearly 44 days by consuming one small ball of the mixture every morning and before two weeks I got my periods.

Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study.

Q. I am expecting first child and pregnant of around 6 weeks. Noticed some bleeding while urinating,"Hi doctor, I am pregnant of around 6 weeks now. This is my first pregnancy.

Is thereÂ anything serious in my case?Â Can I continue my normal work? Can I take Duphaston 10 mg for next 8 weeks as directed my doctor? What kind of precaution do I need to take?","Hi. You have a given a complete account of the clinical situation and it is as good as doing a real time face to face consultation. It is not uncommon for women to have spotting early in pregnancy. Most often it is what we call implantation bleeding that is a process of baby getting attached to your uterus. The fact that there is no blood clot in the uterus and the fetal heart beat is present is reassuring. The diagnosis is called threatened miscarriage. In this situation there is a good probability for the pregnancy to go on well that is more than 90%, hence it is unlikely to be serious. You can continue with your normal activities as long as it is not physically demanding. It is also advisable to avoid sexual intercourse for a few weeks. Absolute bed rest is not needed and in fact may be harmful can lead to blood clots in legs. No need to follow diet restriction. Taking Duphaston (Dihydrogesterone) is alright, but again not absolutely necessary. Just be your normal self. Repeat scan in two weeks to ensure things are fine. You will continue to have some form of discharge pink or red or brown or black for a couple of weeks. But, if the bleeding is heavy with clots or with cramping or foul smelling discharge you need to visit the hospital as soon as possible. I would like to stress that more than 90% of times, things will go on well. For further information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online -->"

Withdrawal bleeding usually occurs 48 hours after stopping the drug to up to 7 days. If you are still in that period, then you should wait for your period to commence. If you are over that, then I suggest you to do certain tests like transvaginal sonography, TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone) and AMH (anti-mullerian hormone testing).

Please check if there is any pus discharge, pain in the tooth and any other area of the mouth also has this kind of spots. Aphthous ulcer often causes minimal symptoms or problems. Oral ulcers are small round or ovoid ulcers of 2 - 4 mm in diameter. They are round or ovoid in most situations but are often more linear in common site.

Q. What is the chance of spread of hepatitis B through food contaminated with blood?,"Hello doctor, Is there any chance of hepatitis B spread through eating food contaminated with infected blood?","Hello. Well, the whole blood and serum (white fluid within blood) contains large amount of virus, and virus can live on blood spots outside the human body for the duration of one week. So actually it depends upon how much blood, and how much time it has been on the stain that can determine the chances of acquiring infection if contaminated with food. So I guess my answer can be partially answering your query. If you tell me the exact event I may be in a better position to tell you the figures. Otherwise, as a general rule, hepatitis B does not spread via food, having said that, it can still spread if blood contaminated food has been ingested. Since virus invades the human body when comes in close to mucosa (lining of our mouth) and then spread to blood within human. This happens in the same way as one infected person can transmit infection via kissing, hugging, sharing of a towel, spoon, plates, and so on. If you are puzzled with all that information, I want you to simply get a blood test for hepatitis B infection. It is a simple blood test that can give us a clue. I hope this helps.

Q. There is a lump above my left collarbone. Is it cancerous?,"Hello doctor, I consulted two doctors regarding a lump that I could feel above my left collarbone, whenever I strain or turn my neck. Both the doctors said that it was just a prominent tendon, but gave me an ultrasound to ease my mind. The ultrasound said 'there is a 6 by 4 mm hypoechoic nodule in my left supra clavicular area, presumably representing a small lymph node. If clinically indicated, an MRI or a CT can be done for further evaluation. On seeing the reports, one of the doctors said that I need a biopsy right away. The other doctor referred me to an ENT. I followed up with the ENT, but he was not able to feel the lymph node and said that the lump is just a prominent muscle and nothing to worry about. The ENT also said that the ultrasound was normal and that a 6 by 4 mm node is normal and nothing to worry about. I have been reading online, and it is mentioned everywhere that a hypoechoic nodule is cancerous, especially in the left collar bone area. What does a hypoechoic nodule mean? Does this mean it is a small cancerous lymph node? What does it mean by 'if clinically indicated, a CT or MRI can be done for further evaluation.'? I also had a CBC done, and that was normal. I had a neck CT done six months ago for a pulled muscle, and that was normal as well. If it did not detect this small nodule six months back, can it have grown in just six months? Is hypoechoic bad? Why did the ultrasound say presumably a lymph node? I am so worried now. Do I need a biopsy or is there nothing to worry about?","Hello. There is a lymph node in the left supraclavicular region called as Virchow's node. If enlarged, it may indicate a malignancy of the abdominal region as that is the draining pathway of the lymph from that area. A lymph node from cancer is generally very hard to palpate. A soft node is generally secondary to some inflammatory response, generally an infection. Please ask your doctor to have a look at your abdomen and re-evaluate the node, although I am almost certain, it is nothing but an inflamed node. As it is of a short duration, it is highly unlikely to be anything dangerous. I suggest you get the following tests: For further queries consult an internal medicine physician online -->"
Q. Is it possible to get nerve related problems due to high lipids and blood glucose levels?,"Hi doctor, I have developed symptoms of nerve dysfunction (burning, tingling, etc.) but all the nerve related tests were normal.

My blood glucose last year was 86, then it went up to 97 by the fall, and then up to 106 this year. I went on a diet and lost 20 lbs so far, but the test this week was at 101 after a 12-hour fast. My question is this: Can a blood glucose around 100 to 105 and high lipids for numerous months cause any nerve related symptoms?","Hello. I have seen the details given. The glucose levels mentioned are normal. Only 106 mg shows a pre-diabetic fasting level. These levels are unlikely to affect the nerve function. From your information, I get a feeling that you do not have diabetes. Is that right? In that case the nerve related issue is not due to glucose levels at all. It may be related to your obesity. With a BMI of 37.07 kg/sq meter (normal < 25 kg/sq meter) you are already in grade 2 obesity. Your ideal body weight should be 77 kg (169.4 pounds). Which means there is an excess of over 81 pounds.

Q. How can chronic body pain associated with movement be tested?,"Hello doctor, I am a 44-year-old man with undiagnosed chronic body pain associated with movement. Sed rate and CRP in normal range, uric acid level tested after a bout of kidney stones last year, but that was also in normal range. Is there any tests you could suggest to my attending? Please advise.","Hello. The normal ESR and CRP essentially rules out inflammatory conditions. Uric acid levels, if high, can lead to joint pains, not body pains. Based on you height and weight, your body mass index is 37.3. This is considered morbid obesity. People with high BMIs can have issues like obstructive sleep apnea, impaired glucose tolerance and high blood pressure. Obstructive sleep apnea can present with manifestations like chronic fatigue and chronic body pains among others. If you are known to snore, have apneic spells (spells during sleep where your breathing stops for several seconds intermittently), feel fatigued and sleepy during the daytime, have frequent headaches and irritability, ask your doctor to screen you for obstructive sleep apnea. If present, that may explain your chronic body pains. Even if you do not have symptoms of OSA, losing weight can improve your overall health and prevent development of metabolic diseases like diabetes. If you want to lose weight, I suggest cutting down on carbohydrates and consuming healthy fats. This is a low carbohydrate, high and healthy fat diet (otherwise called ketogenic diet)."

If fever, malaise, and sore throat occur than investigate by CBC (complete blood count) and serological test for EBV, which includes ESP (extrasensory perception), Ig M (immunoglobulin M), and Elisa (Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay). Infectious mononucleosis usually resolves by its own with time.

In a couple of months, I become quite well but one sudden day pus came out from the same area along with pain. My surgeon said it was fine as the pus was there during the healing period. But this gets worsen and the area again needs to be cleaned out through a minor surgery.

It is unfortunate that you have to undergo repeated surgeries due to the infection. A combined therapeutic approach including surgical drainage, debridement, and prolonged treatment (more than three months) with combined antimicrobial agents, has been used in managing cases of atypical mycobacterium. In some cases based on clinical assessment, successful treatment requires aggressive debridement of all infected subcutaneous tissues and skin. Surgery does play a major role for these kinds of infections and may have to be repeated. I should be able to give you more inputs if I see the scans and reports. Kindly revert back with the same."

Such diarrhea is seen in Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). IBS is of three types: You seem to be suffering from IBS diarrhea predominant. However, IBS is a diagnosis of exclusion. We investigate suspected cases of IBS with thyroid profile, fasting blood sugar and ultrasound abdomen. If all investigations are normal as you have mentioned blood and stool test (considering these investigations have been performed), then you are probably suffering from irritable bowel syndrome. In case you ever have had blood or mucous in stools, you require a colonoscopy to rule out any evidence of inflammatory bowel disease. I advice the following for treatment of IBS: Idiopathic.

Q. Is it safe to do extraction without wearing gloves?,"Hi doctor, I took my mother to a dentist. She hit the tooth hard with a hammer and chisel to remove the second molar of upper jaw. She has experience as a dentist for 30 years; still she does not wear gloves. I am wondering, is this practice safe? My mother cried during the procedure, but the dentist told it will not pain. My mother cried because of fear. I am looking forward to hear from you. Thank you.","Hello. Getting a tooth removed is a terrifying experience for all. It is the dentist's responsibility to address the patient's concerns and make them feel comfortable. Ideally, the procedure should be explained to the patient beforehand. Infection control is very important for the safety of both the dentist and the patient. A dentist must wear gloves and face mask before any treatment. As far as using a hammer and a chisel, these are the instruments usually present in dental clinic. They are a part of the dental instruments used for teeth extractions, especially in difficult cases. Although, a local anesthetic injection is given prior to removing a tooth, anxious patients may need more than one injection. Also, while the local anesthetic is good for numbing the area, patients can still feel the pressure sensation during tooth removal. In the end, it all comes down to proper communication with your patient and constant reassurance during the procedure."
Q. My fiance ejaculated on my hand. Could I be pregnant?,"Hi doctor, I am not sexually active. But my fiance did foreplay and ejaculated on my hand. I washed my hand with soap after that. I do not remember the semen going near my vagina.Â I am still virgin and he did not penetrate me.Â However, the next day I got worried and took an emergency pill. I still have not got my period and it has been a week. I also have PCOD. Have I missed my period because of PCOD? Or could I be pregnant? Please let me know.","Hello. Please do not be worried. There are no chances of pregnancy at all. Firstly, because you had washed your hand with soap which carried the sperms and sperms do not survive on contact with detergent or soap. Secondly, you have taken an i-pill within 72 hours. Hence, your menses are likely to be delayed due to high progesterone pill you have taken. Now, you should get a withdrawal bleed within next 7-10 days from the day of pill intake. So, you should be patient and wait for the withdrawal. However, if you are anxious then as on today you may get a serum beta hCG test done to rule out any pregnancy conclusively. If the hCG levels are less than 5ng/dL then you are surely pregnancy safe and you can then calmly wait for your menses to arrive naturally."
Q. Is it possible to insert GPRS chip inside ear?,"Hi doctor, Recently, I had an operation in left external auditory canal under general anesthesia. I am having doubt that some GPRS tracking system has been inserted during operation. Is it possible to insert GPRS or something like that inside ear?Â Please help me.","Hello. Yes, it is technically possible to implant a small GPRS (general packet radio service) chip in your post aural region. But, that type of device cost a lot. I do not think that anyone can access to that type of device as shown in most of spy movies. So, do not worry. Nobody is going to track you. If still you have any doubt then you can do an x-ray of mastoid region to clarify it."

Q. Is it normal to have palpitations with high blood pressure?,"Hi doctor, I am 18 years old and I have started to struggle with palpitations. When I was around 12 I started having high blood pressure and since then it has not stopped. I have gotten many tests done for my heart and all have turned out normal, but I am still concerned. I do have a poor diet and I am not very active. Could this be causing my heart problem or could it be something more worse?","Hi. You have done many tests with cardiac point of view? First of all, raised blood pressure in very young age, 12 years in your case, should be investigated. It must be secondary to some other disease. One of which is called pheochromocytoma. This condition causes both high BP and high pulse rate, along with sweating, fever. These symptoms are sudden and episodic. Pheochromocytoma is basically a tumor of adrenal glands. Other cause of high pulse rate may be hyperthyroidism in which thyroid gland is overfunctioning. Other symptoms include warm hands, sweaty hands, heat intolerance, weight loss despite good appetite, fine tremors, diarrhea, reduced sleep, thyroid gland may also be enlarged, some changes in eyes, etc. As you said your diet is not good, so it may have caused anemia. Anemia leads to fast heart rate. Another cause may be your sedentary lifestyle. As you said you are not active, it causes fast heart rate on slight activity. These are some non-cardiac causes of fast heart rate. Cardiac causes may be atrial fibrillation, inappropriate sinus tachycardia, atrial tachycardia, etc. Detection and differentiation of these requires ECG. If one of these is diagnosed, then next step is to detect the cause of it. Then treatment is done for the cause. So, possibilities of your condition are many. There is a huge list of differentials both cardiac and non-cardiac. Proper diagnosis requires focused investigations. Please provide your previous tests (ECG, holter, etc.) so that I may devise a plan for diagnosis of your condition which may require some other tests as well. Also send a record of daily BP and pulse rate of one week at least. Remember, if pheochromocytoma is the cause, then high BP and fast pulse may be present only during episodes and normal between episodes. Beta blocker is good to control heart rate. So please follow-up with your medical record and BP, pulse rate record."
Q. What does polycythemia (JAK 2 negative) mean?,"Hello doctor, I am diagnosed with polycythemia (JAK 2 negative). I need more knowledge, my BM and JAK 2 studies are within normal limit.","Hello. Your present CBC report is not suggestive of polycythemia especially polycythemia vera which is blood cancer condition (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Your JAK 2, EXON 12 study and bone marrow report is normal as per history. So polycythemia vera is very less likely. Your high hemoglobin could be due to secondary polycythemia cause. Secondary polycythemia is pure benign condition. The causes for that include respiratory problem, cardiac problem, smoking, severe dehydration, etc. I suggest you drink lots of water especially three litres per day. Avoid smoking if having habit. It is advisable to repeat CBC again after a few days."

Yesterday, he had palpitations, and some tingling was then sent for an ECG. The findings are sinus rhythm, marked right axis deviation, and ECG without any abnormalities. Would you be able to see it and assess what further steps I need to take?","Hello. I reviewed carefully your ECG images (attachment removed to protect patient identity) and would explain that besides right axis deviation, I also noticed the presence of prominent P waves in DII lead, which indicates a pattern or left the posterior fascicular block. For this reason, I would recommend performing a cardiac ultrasound to examine the heart and exclude possible structural abnormality. Regarding the tingling, I would also recommend checking the thyroid hormone levels and blood electrolytes for possible imbalance. I hope you will find this answer helpful.

Q. Will Kalarchikai cure multiple ovarian cysts in PCOD?,"Hello doctor, I have multiple small cysts in both ovaries (PCOS).

"Q. I am having the symptoms of frequent urination, dizziness, and white thin cervical mucus. Will I be pregnant?","Hello doctor,I am 32 years and trying to conceive since last six months. My last period was a month before, and intercourse was 10 days after that for four days. I have been facing the following symptoms like frequent urination, dizziness, etc. However, there was clear milky white thin cervical mucus until this month.However, it was less or hardly visible in quantity. I am not sure if it was too slippery for me to have noticed as well. But I did not get thick cervical mucus. And today morning I got traces or a very minute or small thick cervical mucus and negligible in quantity. I am waiting for a missed period, which is due next week. I am anxious because of the absence of cervical mucus. Am I pregnant? Please help.","Hello. I have gone through your query. You have been sexually active during your fertile period till the end of last month. Now, the presence of thickening of cervical mucus is a possible sign of conception but not conclusive. The earliest now, considering your anxiety, you can be tested conclusively for pregnancy is after eight days post last intercourse is with a serum beta hCG test (blood test).

Q. My facial hair is less. Can I take DHEA supplements for beard growth?,"Hello doctor,I am a 28-year-old man with very less facial hair. Recent blood check-up shows that my DHEAS value is 195.9.

So, I would like to take DHEA supplements for beard growth, is it fine?","Hello. I think it is very normal to have less hair on the face. Even if you have little hairs, it is normal. Do not worry about your DHEAS level. You should not be taking any hormonal treatment unless it is required and so you can consult an endocrinologist for it. If you have normal sexual functioning, you should not worry about it. If it bothers you too much, you can ask a hair transplant surgeon and get a nice beard transplant. Focus on a healthy diet and regular exercise."
Q. Why does the pulse rate fall in a 4-year-old after administration of Epinephrine?,"Hello doctor, I am reviewing the patient care of a 4-year-old child diagnosed with the flu. He was having trouble breathing, so we called an ambulance. I was very apprehensive about him receiving any drugs from a doctor. His pulse was 149, 161, and 150. The medic then said his pulse was falling, which I did not see. He then requested an order to give Epinephrine, which does not make sense to me. His pulse rate then fell quickly. What is your opinion?","Hello. An ECG should have been done immediately to see if the child was having VT, SVT, or anything else that would require you to slow down the heart. Based on the ECG, the next step could have been planned. This is because you have only written to me about the heart rate. The other aspects, like breathing and circulation (blood pressure), also decide the modality of treatment. Does it make sense to give epinephrine to a child having tachycardia? However, if there was no pulse afterward, epinephrine should be given at that particular time."
Q. Please have a look over MRI and suggest that the fibrotic is still visible on the MRI.,"Hello doctor, Pain after idiopathic orbital inflammation before 11 years. I have undergone biopt two times due to inflammation with fibrosis and sclerosis. Now the doctors say the disease is gone. But I am still in pain and again using 15 mg Prednisone a day. They told me I have neuropathic pain, and this is more often in other patients with pseudotumor orbitae. My question is, can fibrotic tissue that is still visible on the MRI, cause the pain? Is there inflammation seen on the MRI? Or abnormalities or myositis?","Hello. I saw the MRI (attachment removed to protect patient identity), the sclerotic tissue from which we have to confirm that the pain you are experiencing is mainly neuropathic and emerging not from the sclerotic tissues as much as from the adjacent structures that are rich with nerves and blood vessels. Due to the anatomic changes that the eye has gone through, all the adjacent structures are still adapting to those newly acquired conditions, and that is what most probably is causing the pain. Whether it is from the compression or the disturbance in blood supply, currently, there is not much to do but to keep reducing the inflammation and prevent future reoccurrence with the prednisolone, but specific preventive measures such as undergoing a comprehensive eye exam as per the ophthalmologist recommendations are necessary. That examination should include tonometry - intraocular pressure, perimetry-visual fields, and optical coherence tomography to exclude any newly acquired changes that might require intervention. As for the diagnosis, although not much changes to the treatment will take place, it should be enforced with a blood test called ANA (antinuclear antibodies) profile to exclude any autoimmune disease that might develop on other organs. I would add a course of Neurobion, which is a complex of vitamins group B and might want to consult a physiotherapist on a method to improve blood circulation in the affected area. I hope I have cleared a few of your questions, and please feel free to follow up with additional inquiries or test results."

Q. Will taking Sibelium for migraine delay the periods?,"Hello doctor, I am taking Sibelium 10 mg from last some weeks for my migraine and last month I missed my periods. Kindly clarify the reson. Is it delaying due to this medicine?","Hello. On the aspect of missing your period can be Sibelium (Flunarizine) because it has some effect of blocking the dopamine receptor in the brain. Besides, it is a calcium channel blocking effect. So the possibility is that by blocking the dopamine receptor that will cause a central increase of prolactin. Prolactin will lead to galactorrhea and in turn, alter the menstrual cycle. So it is a possibility that is if you have done a pregnancy test and it is negative. So that dopaminergic antagonistic may cause amenorrhea."

However, if you are feeling lightheaded upon standing, then you need evaluation to see if your blood pressure drops when you stand up. Your blood counts and urinalysis are normal. Your thyroid hormones Total T4 and Total T3 are within normal ranges. A single low TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone) reading may need confirmation with a repeat test. Are you on thyroid hormone supplements? What are your height and weight? You have been prescribed an antibiotic (Mahacef plus). There is no reason for you to take medicines. I suggest stopping it. Also, no indication to take Citro Soda (you do not have a urine infection). Your health is fine, and so you can stop all the medicines. Your symptoms may have other causes like lack of sleep, stress, etc. You will need further evaluation. You can start by getting a repeat TSH test done at a standard laboratory. Stop the medicines you have been prescribed currently. Once you have the repeat TSH level, you can get back to me."
Q. I am a PCOS patient and my prolactin level is 42. Kindly explain.,"Hello doctor,I have PCOS, and my recent report says that prolactin level is 42, what does it mean? Otherwise, my period is normal.","Hello. The serum prolactin levels are high, which indicate hyperprolactinemia. This can cause hypomenorrhoea or shortened menses even though the cycles may be regular. The PCOD (polycystic ovarian syndrome) element further adds to insulin resistance and putting on weight. The aim of the treatment should be the PCOD regimen and Dopamine agonists like Cabergoline tablet to control and treat both PCOD and hyperprolactinemia, respectively. The classical sign of hyperprolactinemia is the discharge of watery substance from breast nipples, also known as galactorrhea. This often leads to breast heaviness and tenderness."

Q. Is it normal to have bulging veins in arms and legs with pain?,"Hi doctor, I am 19 years old and I am currently experiencing an issue with the veins in my arms and legs, primarily on the left side of my body.

It was concerning but not painful until a few days later, it gave me extreme shooting, throbbing pain. This lasted for a about a week then started to fade to what it is today, a numb pain that gets sharp if I support my weight too much on that foot. This has limited my movement quite a bit, which makes it hard to complete my daily tasks, and I cannot wear closed toe shoes anymore without pain. The problem got even more concerning when other veins in my body started to bulge ang give pain, first in my legs, and now in my hands and arms. My left hand is my primary one and now I cannot lift things or write or hold it downwards without having a pain in my arm, where a big vein pops up just below the wrist. This has all happened in the course of a month. Does this condition sound familiar and if so, what should I do to get treatment for it?","Hello. Your problem looks like varicose vein. Veins will bulge when you are standing or moving around when unlike down it regressed and blood flows back into the deeper veins and empty back into the heart. Varicosity is due to incompetence or weakness in the valves within veins which prevents the blood from flowing back as the blood has to be returned to the heart for recirculation. Due to weaknesss in the calf muscle which contracts and compress the deeper veins causing blood to be squeezed out of then for upward emptying into the vena cava and into the heart. Blockage of the pathways of flow or deep veins due to venous thrombosis, usually common in women, tends to increase with age, and with use of contraceptive pills and with pregnancy because of increased intraabdominal pressure which in turn comprises the vena cava and affect return of blood back to the heart. Complications can be venous thrombosis due to increased stasis of blood. If there is so much build up of pressure for long time can cause venous ulcers. Management is elevation of the leg when lying down. Use compression stockings to support and collapse the veins, avoid use of high heels. Change your standing or sitting position from time to time. You can do Doppler ultrasound scan."

Almost all successful people would have failed an exam at some point in their life. Do not put too much pressure on yourself by hiding it from your parents. It can be a difficult burden. Your parents may be upset, but eventually, they will get over it. After initial disappointment settles down, they will support you. Learn to develop coping strategies to manage frustrations.

Do you have any suggestions on what it could be? I am very tired of coughing.","Hello. The cough you say is it dry or sputum? Are you losing weight? Is there any drenching night sweat and persistent low-grade fever? Is there any history of contact with someone with a chronic cough in your locality? Do you smoke, is your occupation such that you are exposed to industrial dust, and asbestos? Is there any associated chest pain, any difficulty in breathing, etc. A small thyroid nodule may not make you cough but if the nodule is impinging on your trachea that can irritate which you claim you notice in your throat. The thyroid check you did was it thyroid function test to know the thyroid hormone profile, because a solitary thyroid nodule may be toxic and can be abnormally producing excessive hormones thyroxine which may cause other possible symptoms such as excessive sweating, weight loss, anxiety, intolerance to hot weather, diarrhea, palpitation (as if your heartbeat is audible to you). If non of these is the case, then you have to do screen for TB, do sputum AFB (acid-fast bacilli) and do GeneXpert, that will rule out tuberculosis.

I read and understand that your concern is about the side effects of the newly prescribed drugs. Reduction of sexual drive is one of the side effects of beta-blocker group of drugs. Concor contains Bisoprolol which is a cardioselective beta-blocker. The systemic side effects of cardioselective beta-blockers are less compared to the general beta-blockers. So the effect of Concor on the sexual drive would not be that significant to affect your usual life. And the combination prescribed is safe to take. There are no significant drug-drug interactions between these group of drugs.

I have attached my report for your reference. I am suffering from recurrent kidney infections in the past couple years and had a stone in my left kidney when I was 15. I have attached my latest blood, urine and CT reports. I am concerned that I have CKD stage 1 from the GFR I calculated using the parameters in these reports. Could you please advise me on this? In general, does GFR improve after a stone is removed through lithotripsy or PCNL? I am scheduled for a lithotripsy in a week. Any information regarding if you think I have CKD and what prognosis will be very helpful?","Hi. I saw all your reports and your clinical details (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Your tendency for recurrent stone formation which needs to be evaluated. You need not to worry about eGFR (estimated glomerular filtration rate) currently as creatinine is normal. Removal of stone will mostly increase GFR. Most importantly after your lithotripsy please send the stone fragments which comes in urine for stone analysis. From that we will have a clear idea how to prevent their recurrence. Secondly, some general measures which include drink at least 3-4 liters of water and restrict salt in your diet up to 2 g in total. Do not take any calcium supplements and restrict or possibly avoid animal protein that is non-vegetarian food for some years. Take lots of water particularly in evening so that you at least wake up twice in night to pass urine. These all are general measures which really worked for many of my patients for future stone prevention. Do some blood tests like serum calcium, phosphorus, uric acid, bicarbonate and magnesium from any reliable laboratory and send for review.

Q. How can I distinguish that I was bitten by a bat or not?,"Hello doctor, I think I was bitten by a bat, so I wanted to know how to know that if I was really bitten by a bat. I did not felt anything at that time but some itching after that. I am not sure that I was bitten by a bat, so I wanted to know how do we feel when bitten by a bat. Also I saw that the thing which landed on my neck was small but had small wings that looked like a bat. I was asking ways to distinguish that I was bitten by a bat or not.","Hello. If a bat bite there will be bite marks, usually superficial. 1)Early symptoms are fever, headache, and general malaise. 2) If the disease progresses, there will be neurological symptoms such as insomnia, anxiety, confusion, agitation, difficulty in swallowing, hallucinations, excessive salivation, paralysis, hydrophobia (fear of water), or agitated behavior. If you still have doubt better go for vaccination ARV (anti-rabies vaccine)."

Q. Can PCOS cause vaginal dryness?,"Hello doctor, I am a 30 year old female. I have history of PCOS and hypothyroid from last year. I also have a history of swollen pituitary gland, but it is normal now. I am only taking a 100 mcg pill for thyroid. My problem is that whenever I indulge in sex with my boyfriend, we are able to have intercourse very rarely as I am unable to produce sufficient lubrication in my vagina for intercourse. I get excited when we spend a lot of time on foreplay and I am not scared of intercourse. I actually love to have intercourse with him, but mostly I do not feel myself sufficiently wet to have intercourse and feel pain while having intercourse. What should I do?","Hi. Although there are multiple reasons for vaginal dryness, the most common among them is deficiency of estrogen, a female hormone. This is possible in your case due to presence of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) which alters the hormonal profile. I will recommend two things which may help you. Firstly, use the topical Estrogen. It is available in the form of gel, ring or cream. As per your convenience you can use either cream or gel and the use of ring requires assistance of doctor. The second thing is stress management. Stress is one of the common reasons for causing decreased vaginal lubrication. Although, there is long list of do's and donot's; principally speaking healthy diet, regular exercise, avoidance of substance abuse, plenty of fluid intake helps most individuals.

"Q. Kindly suggest the management of acne breakouts on my cheeks, neck and ear.","Hello doctor,I am 40 years old. I have major adult acne breakouts mainly on my cheeks, neck, and under my ear. I am dark complexioned, so when it does clear, it leaves scarring and dark spots. The last dermatologist I consulted suggested birth control. Could please give some suggestions?",Hello. I saw your pictures (attachment removed to protect patient identity). I can see pus-filled acne along with post acne pigmentation. Start using Azithromycin 500mg of any brand for six consecutive days after breakfast. Apply Epiduo gel once daily bedtime for a short contact period of 30 minutes then rinses off with cool water. Start biluma cream once daily in the morning on the spots. Avoid all sorts of dairy products bedtime and prefer carrots and spinach along with few soaked almonds. Have reviews about salicylic acid peeling and plan for three sessions accordingly. I hope this will help you.
Q. Is it advisable to get RCT done in a child?,"Hello doctor, My 2.5 years old daughter had a fall around 6 to 7 months back and one of her front teeth was chipped. At that time, it looked fine and till now, she had no pain or any sensitivity issues in eating. But off late, the color of the chipped tooth has turned green. We consulted two dentists, first one was a specialist in child dentistry and recommended an RCT treatment wherein a chemical will be placed to cure the infection. He said that the discoloration will increase with time and this baby tooth might fall off much earlier (in 4 to 5 years) than the expected time (6 to 8 years). The other dentist recommended to observe for six months and see if any rash or boil is developed above the gums and any kind of pain is experienced. He also said that such a tooth might fall off before time. We are confused as to what we should do? If RCT is the way out then we would prefer to get it done before she starts with her formal schooling at 3. But we are mainly concerned if she could endure such a treatment as she is very small. Please provide suggestion. I have attached a photo of the X-ray.","Hi.  I got your chief complaint and opinions of two dentists. As far age is concerned, your daughter still is in need of these teeth as permanent teeth take time to erupt, by 6 to 7 years they will erupt. Till then, healthy front teeth are important otherwise she will develop irregular teeth later. As tooth has changed color so it is better to act on the suggestions of pedodontist and go for pulpectomy or RCT. It will keep the tooth intact and prevent formation of any cyst later. There is nothing wrong with it and there are modern gadgets to do the procedure, she will not feel any kind of pain during the procedure. If you leave it as such, it will weaken with time and may later contribute to huge financial burden to treat irregular teeth."
Q. My urine and blood tests are negative after taking Nucynta. Why?,"Hello doctor, I am a 28-year-old female. I have been on Nucynta for over a year. I take Nucynta ER 50 mg BID and Nucynta IR 50 mg once a day. For the last two months, my urine tests (immunoassay and lab testing) have come back negative. Two weeks ago a blood test was done and it was also negative. I religiously take these medicines as prescribed by my pain management doctor. Due to these negatives he is now refusing to prescribe any oral medications (including my Flexeril, Gabapentin, and oral Ketamine). I understand his need to be able to prove to Nucynta in my system but he is also refusing to try anything else. I am a walking genetic defect. I also have known pharmacogenetic and pharmacokinetic issues. I also have EDS, CRPS, POTS, MCAS, gastroparesis (severe enough that EGD showed food in my stomach 18 hours after last eating), endometriosis. Could any of this be causing the problem? Could any of the medicines I take be causing the problem? My medicines are Lopressor, Trazadone, Fetzima, Zyrtec, Ketamine, Magnesium Citrate pills, Melatonin, Gabapentin, Flexeril, Nucynta, Junel Fe. What suggestions do you have? Is there any research to help me?","Hi.  Nucynta is an opioid analgesic, that has high first-pass metabolism when administered orally. It means only 32 % of orally administered dose reaches blood. After it produces its effect, 97 % gets metabolized in gastrointestine and liver and gets excreted out from body through urine.   In your case, you have delayed (slow) intestinal movements, hence the drug may get faster metabolism and faster excretion than a normal individual. Hence, I think it is not detectable in blood or urine.   Another possibility is very less amount of drug reaches your blood (less than 32 %) due to intestinal absorption issues. The half-life of this drug is four hours in healthy individual. It means, after oral administration, 32 % drug reaches the blood within 3 to 4 hours. If I draw the blood after four hours of oral administration, the amount showing in blood is expected to be 16 % (50 % of drug gets excreted by four hours). It is in a normal person. In your case, when to draw blood is the question. So, individualistic reasearch could be done for you with special care."
"Q. After lying on stomach for 20 minutes, I get most intense headache. Is this brain aneurysm?","Hi doctor, I was lying on my stomach for about 20 minutes.

Our family friend suggested me to consume Kalarchikai medicine, powdered mixed with pepper and honey to have it for one mandalam (48 days).

Q. I am having pain after inguinal hernia and hydocele operation. Please help.,"Hi doctor, After suffering with groin pain, I had a double operation 12 weeks ago. During the operation, I had a repair of left side inguinal hernia and right hand hydrocele. I am now in more pain than I was before the operation. My testicle thorns with pain constantly and I have stabbing pain on hernia side. It feels like someone is sticking a bottle in me. I am struggling to walk very far, climb stairs and drive. I am unable to have a sex life. Is it normal to do both operations at the same time? Can you explain any possible cause for pain?","Hi. Well, ideally if you have bilateral inguinal hernia, or inguinaÄº hernia on one side and hydrocele on the other, the surgery should be done for one first before the other, not simultaneously so that when you are fully recovered of one, then the other can be planned and done. Pain can be due to entrapment of a nerve like ileoinguinal or ileohypogastric nerves which run with the spermatic cords or it could be also present if there is improper repair with subsequent breakdown of the repair and subsequent herniation of the bowel content into the inguinal ring or it can be from infection of the operation site. 12 weeks is quite a long time for surgical pains to have disappeared. You will need to do an abdominal pelvic ultrasound scan to see if there is any reccurence or failure of the surgery or if there is entrapment of visceral content."
Q. Can my cholesterol increase again if I miss Lipitor?,"Hi doctor, I have lost my prescription for Lipitor and have been taking it for four days. I will get it tomorrow. I am on 10 mg a day. I am worried, will my cholesterol go up in that time since I am not taking it?","Hi.  The half life of Lipitor (Atorvastatin) is 14 hours in humans (meaning drug is eliminated in about 14 hours). The main effect of Lipitor is to block the buildup and making of cholesterol in body. It does the job together with the help of other active ingredients and its effect on cholesterol synthesis is maintained in the body for about 20 to 30 hours. In this situation, it does not seem an issue if you just missed a dose or so. Do not worry about it. But start taking medication as soon as you get it back."

I presume that this recurrent anal yeast infection is candidiasis, and you have been using a topical mixture of antifungal and corticosteroid cream over it. Have you checked for immune statuses like HIV, and blood sugar level to rule out diabetes? Then if you have been using a steroid medicine for a very long time, that can also depress your immunity.

Get Fluconazole tablet 200 mg daily for two weeks that will kill the candida from inside. You may also continue your Clotrimazole-Betamethasone cream till the yeast disappears. I want you to run a test for HIV and blood sugar."

I have symptoms of ADHD like fidgeting, restlessness, being very talkative, losing focus or attention, but I am very extroverted, and my academic ratings are good. Does someone get ADHD in their teenage years? And am I one of those people?","Hello. ADHD (attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder) is a developmental condition which is noticeable since early childhood. Symptoms like hyperactivity, impulsivity, inattention will be present before the age of 12 years. Parents and teacher would have commented about it even in nursery and early primary school years. It is unlikely for someone to develop to ADHD in teenage years without having any symptoms before. Other causes like anxiety, too much stress and pressure, family, and social problems need to be ruled out. Also, important criteria for diagnosis is functional impairment like you may not be able to do well in academics and not able to achieve your potential. But you report doing well.

Do you have a regular menstrual cycle? Any hair growth on the face, arms which is unusual than before? Scanty periods can mean oligomenorrhea (the medical term for decreased blood flow). Weight gain, hair growth, and oligomenorrhea are typical symptoms of a condition called PCOD (polycystic ovarian syndrome) which happens in girls, and multiple cysts are present in ovaries, and this leads to these symptoms.

I suspect three things, it is just assumption based on history. 1. Stomach ulcer, as she had pain after food and water. 2. Worm infection, need to have a look after food. 3. If non of the above, must be ruled out by investigations. Then it is called functional abdominal pain. I advise you to visit a specialist. She might require one-week antibiotics and if symptoms not settled, then endoscopy also. But the best part is to visit the pediatrician. So he can evaluate her in detail and examine her. Meanwhile, you can give symptomatic treatment. Kindly consult your doctor to discuss the suggestion and take the treatment with consent."
Q. I am suffering from severe stomach pain after having medications for headache. Kindly advice.,"Hello doctor, I had a constant headache for two days then I visited a close-by pharmacy and I was asked to treat malaria. I was given Metherine Forte tablets (Artemether 80 mg and Lumefantrine 480 mg tablets) and two cards of Paucofenacmol Caplets. Two days after taking the drugs as prescribed by the pharmacist, I started having some stomach bites, serious ones which tended to go down after I eat. It made me eat often. I went back to the pharmacy and was given worm drugs Tindex 500 (Tinidazole Tablets 500 mg) and Wormplan (Albendazole tablets 400 mg). I took those worm drugs in the morning today, yet my stomach pains are still severe.","Hello. You have a persistent headache in the frontal part of your head. Was there fever, chills, and rigor, were you feeling like vomiting, after taking those drugs prescribed for you? Did your headache subside? The medicines given at the pharmacy are fine for malaria, but it may not have been malaria, but it could be Salmonella typhi infection, which causes typhoid fever. Worm medicine is fine in the case. I will advise you to go to a lab and do blood film for malaria parasite, do Widal test and stool microscopy culture and sensitivity. If there is salmonella infection E coli or any enterobacteria infection, the stool MCS will detect it. If there is worm infestation such as hookworm or tapeworm, it will also pick it in microscopy. You can take tablet Buscopan (hyoscine butylbromide) 10 mg thrice daily. Then get tablet Ciprofloxacin 500 mg bd (twice daily) take them for five days. You can add tablet Rabeprazole 20 mg bd in case if there is any peptic ulcer since the description of the pain and the location in your abdomen was not very precise. Enteric fever. Malaria. Intestinal spasm. PUD(peptic ulcer disease)"
Q. My sciatica is heavy after a minor herniated disc L4 or L5. Why?,"Hello, I had a minor herniated disc L4 or L5 last year. (MRI confirmed nerve pinch, but no broken disc or liquid leaks) With heavy pain, I was hospitalized, but recovered within two weeks. With Ibuprofen and muscle relaxants, I was able to walk and function pretty normally. Sciatica (leg nerve pain) came and go during the time now and when I was in the hospital last year. Right now, I am experiencing almost no back pain, but the sciatica is heavy. Mostly on the back of my left upper leg, down till the end of the knee. I am doing stretching exercises, belly position, upper body up, or on the back, leg stretches towards the torso, plank training, etc. But I still have to sit a lot due to my job. I tried a standing desk, which resulted in feet pain and also more sciatia. Though I am sitting straight, the fascinating thing is that heat and cold are influencing sciatica. As long as I apply heat to the leg (not the lower back), the pain disappears instantly to an almost level of no pain. A bit of cold and the pain becomes very heavy immediately as well. Can there be an underlining other issue causing it?","Hello. As it is a year old injury now I will suggest doing some physical test like McKenzie maneuver to see if the radiating symptoms stops and the pain gets centralize to the lower back. The McKenzie maneuver is simple, and you can read about it and practice it. Now I think there is still a muscle weakness which is leading to nerve root entrapment like the lateral spinal muscles, paraspinal muscles, hip muscles, etc. I advice to not use cold therapy as it is aggravating the pain symptoms. Do proper exercise which will regain the strength in the muscles and avoid nerve root entrapment. In most cases, the pain is caused due to more of the muscle weakness, and it is common in most cases to have received the symptoms back. Doing proper exercise with proper guidance can resolve the matter."

"Q. What can be done for dryness, redness and red lines in both eyes?","Hello doctor, I have dryness, redness and red lines in both eyes. No liquid discharge. Right eye hurts sometime. I have 5 to 6 hours work on laptops.","Hi. People spending longer time on computer, laptop screens have greater chances of developing dry eyes. Because while using computer, blink rate is decreased to 1 to 2 time per minute. Normal blinking is necessary to keep eye surface wet and eyelids function as wipers and spread tear film on corneal surface. If you do not blink, eye surface gets dry and you will feel irritation of grittiness or mild redness. Longer time you spend on screen, more chances of developing dry eyes.  So you need to slightly modify blinking habbits while working on laptop, screen. You should blink every 15 to 20 seconds to keep eyes wet. Secondly, you can use artifical tears, lubricants to minimize dryness. You can use Systane eye drop or Tears Naturale eye drop or any other tears available to you. You can use 3 to 4 times but you can also use more frequently if you feel so. There is no side effect of these drops, these are only artificial tears. I hope your problem will be solved."

You can keep reducing the sugar content of the milk slowly slowly until you reach a stage where there is no sugar in the milk. Also, you can check for your current milk output to see if even little is there. If even a little is there, please give the child breast for sometime and if the child suckles, let him suckle.

Slowly slowly a stage will come wherein your milk output will be enough to satisfy the hunger of the child and you will not need top feeds."

White discharge with blister-like appearance and sore to touch generally points towards an infection, but an infection occurring simultaneously in both breasts at the same time is very rare.

Need some more information too, Do you have a fever? How are your menstrual cycles? Is it regular? Is the flow high? Do you feel any small lump behind the nipples? Do you take medicines for any other problem? Do not mistake me, but your problem needs a direct clinical examination to visualize the breast, discharge and to see if there are any lumps behind the nipples.

Q. My 1-year-old kid has -3. 5 and -2. 5 refractive error. Do he needs glasses?,"Hello doctor, My child is one year old. On routine examination his eye has a power of minus 3.5 and minus 2.5 refractive error. What is the normal refractive error at this age as refraction continues to change? Doctor said to follow up after six months as glasses may be needed if power increases. Please help.","Hello. First of all, let me tell you that visual development takes until the age of puberty. As your child grows, his vision parameters will change because his eyeball grows with him as he ages. So visual stability will continue to change until the age of 18-20 years old. Normally the child is born with a plus refractive error unlike the case here. Your child has a condition called myopia which is a refractive error with a minus as you said. But that is completely fixable as the child grows whether by glasses, contact lenses, or LASIK surgery if it continues and he needs to take glasses off later. The most important examination in his age is something called a red reflex. You should ask your doctor if he has done it to him. Also, I would ask about the fundus examination too. If both were normal, I would not have any concerns. I want to reassure you that your child's eyes are in good health. He just needs to be examined precisely every follow up every six months as your doctor suggested, just to make sure everything is going right and to treat anything if something happens early. The glasses will not be tolerated by a child as his age is too small, as soon as he can tolerate glasses, put them on. That could happen in two years. If you need further assistance do not hesitate to contact me."
Q. I have body pain and not interested in any work after having Uvox CR. Why?,"Hello doctor, I am a 44-year-old female. My height is 161 cm and weight 87 kg. Clarify one doubt about an antidepressant. My new psychiatrist started Uvox CR 10 days back. I was on Stalopam for three to four years before that. For the past some days, I am feeling body pains and disinterested to do any work at all. But I somehow manage to complete the work also but with a lot of effort. Will the medicine take time to set? Why do I have these symptoms?","Hello.  Antidepressant take around two weeks to show their effect as this much time is required to make changes in chemicals present in the brain. The symptoms you mentioned are typical of depression. Stalopam (Escitalopram) and Uvox CR (Fluvoxamine) both are antidepressant from SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) group but somewhat different profile. In the next few days, you will see some relief as 10 days already passed since starting on Uvox CR. Also, check your thyroid status as you are already on Thyroxine75 mcg and check that this dose is sufficient or not. Meanwhile, do regular exercise and go for a walk for at least 45 minutes, five times a week. Maintain good sleep hygiene and spend time on your hobbies. I hope it clarifies your concern and feel free to ask if anything unanswered."
Q. I become nervous and faint when I try to masturbate. Why does this happens?,"Hello doctor, When I try to masturbate or when I am thinking of it, I became very nervous, and a little fainted. I do not know why.","Hello. Well, in this case, the jerk you had in your first experience is called ejaculation. I am sure you did not take any libido-enhancing drug cause that may also amplify the symptoms. And usually, there is adrenalin surge during ejaculation, which can cause a sudden increase in your heart rate, nervousness and eventually tiredness during ejaculation. After the entire process is over, then eventually you will become calm. I guess your fear may be stemmed from your first experience. Those symptoms you felt are normal for every man who has sex when it is time to ejaculate. It is not a problem. It is a normal physiological respond during ejaculation. So relax, nothing to worry about you are fine. I believe your subsequent experience will make you understand that it is normal. Erotophobia, sexual anxiety."

Last night we had sex with a condom, but I have doubt it may be unsafe. Her period occurs once in one and a half months. Other than this she does not have any gynecological problem. Can she take any contraceptive pill like Unwanted 72?","Hello,  Welcome to icliniq.com. Though your wife is in the late part of her reproductive age and might be approaching her menopause, yet if she continues to have her menstrual cycles regularly there is a chance that she might be still ovulating and if intercourse happens in her fertile period she might conceive. It is better she takes Unwanted 72 this time.

So please do a pregnancy test also if she does not have her periods at the scheduled time. After her next periods follow up for an effective contraceptive with additional benefits for hormone replacement appropriate for her age."

Still, now it is continuing even if I take proper rest during exam time when I study less also.","Hello. Left eye pain and hot feeling in your head is due to severe mechanical stress to your body because of extreme mental exertion and lack of sleep for three days. As a neurologist, my first advice will be to take some rest and be relaxed and calm. To take rest and enough sleep at least five to six hours in a day is a part of exam preparation.

Have adequate fluid intake. 2. Avoid dry fruits, cold drinks, and chocolate. 3. Avoid broccoli, spinach, beans, and non-vegetarian diet. I would highly recommend testing uric acid once again after one month to reassess the uric acid value. As a single high value should not be the basis for starting medical treatment. Because the treatment usually has to be continued for a long period. So begin the diet modification from today, and repeat uric acid after a month, and review again for further advice. As a patient with high uric acid has an increasing tendency to form renal calculi, I will also advise sonography of abdomen and pelvis, if already not done, before the surgery. Uric acid, RFT (renal function test), sonography of abdomen and pelvis. Review after one month with the above mentioned test."

Within the epithelial cell aggregates, nuclear streaming and an admixed myoepithelial cell population is revealed. No dissociated malignant cell population or true papillary epithelial cell aggregates with fibrovascular cores are identified.","Hi. This is a picture suggestive of a fibroadenoma. It is not a malignant bump. But, FNAC identifies only the part that has been included in that needle. So to confirm, we do a trucut biopsy which tests the entire lump and is conclusive. 99 % this is a non-cancerous lump."
Q. Is it advisable to undergo super Lasik surgery in a 37-year-old person?,"Hello doctor, I am planning to undergo vision correction surgery. I am 37 years old, female, single. My ophthalmologist informed me that I have astigmatism. I am short sighted. My doctor suggested of a super Lasik surgery. Can you please advise if I should go ahead with this surgery? Secondly, what would be the side effects? And the recovering period. The doctor did mention I have a thick cornea and I will recover the same day. But I am not very confident and require your second opinion.","Hello. It is hard to advise you fully not knowing the full refractive status of your eyes and seeing the keratotopgraphy report that you underwent already and must have a report of it, you could upload it here for better evaluation. However, you have to understand that a human eye starts changing its refraction after the age of 40 and will continue to change every five years after that. So you will enjoy the result of this operation for a maximum of five years and then you will start wearing spectacles for near so keep that in mind. The second issue that you might face a new condition, that is if you are not suffering from it before the operation, and that is dry eye for which you still need to use a lubricant at least four times daily for the rest of your life. In summary, the choice is upto you of course but at such an age, I would not advise. If you would like a more decisive advice, please upload the reports."
Q. Pregnancy kit shows positive result but ultrasound shows no pregnancy. Please help.,"Hello doctor, My period got delayed by 10 days and after checking with a pregnancy kit, I found out that I am pregnant. But, when underwent sonography, there was no pregnancy. I have not got my periods yet and have vomiting and giddiness. Please help.","Hello.  I would suggest you to repeat pregnancy test immediately and if again positive then repeat ultrasound as well to see what is happening and you can start taking Folic acid meanwhile. In the early pregnancies, sometimes sac is not seen and it becomes visible as pregnancy progresses. So, if pregnancy test is still positive then sac must become visible and if pregnancy test becomes negative that means that the previous one could be a false positive one."
"Q. I take Olanzapine. Why am I having headache, cramps, nausea, and bad morning sickness?","Hello doctor, I have headache, cramps, nausea, bad morning sickness, back pain, hunger, feel light headed. I am taking Olanzapine and Zyprexa.","Hi. The symptoms that you mentioned are common side-effects of Olanzapine (Zyprexa). Please, do your best to tolerate the side-effects especially in the beginning of therapy (if you just started taking the medicines) as in some situations the side effects decrease in intensity by time. I strongly advise you not to stop this medicine or skip doses as it is extremely important to stick to its dosage and continue to follow up with your doctor."

Q. Will Kalarchikai cure multiple ovarian cysts in PCOD?,"Hello doctor, I have multiple small cysts in both ovaries (PCOS). Our family friend suggested me to consume Kalarchikai medicine, powdered mixed with pepper and honey to have it for one mandalam (48 days). I have completed nearly 44 days by consuming one small ball of the mixture every morning and before two weeks I got my periods. Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged. Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well.","Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally. Medicine is not of much help."

"Q. Why am I having extreme bloating, abdominal pain, and fatigue with scaly marks?","Hello doctor, I have been having increased issues with extreme bloating, abdominal pain, fatigue, vomiting a lot of the time, excessive diarrhea, weird tiny patches of scaly marks on my shins, arms, and face. I literally dread eating anything. I am not starving by any means, I have more than enough meat on my bones but eating is worse than feeling pains of hunger. This has been increasing year by year and has been present for about five years now. My PCP is related to stress but I know there is something much more dire going on. I recently did an at home test for food sensitivities and I had reactions to 93 out of 96 foods tested. Does not seem quite right to me and I understand that IgG does not test for allergies. I am highly reactive to citrus as well as baker's yeast. Previously I thought I was having an allergy to the protein found in wheat and I went on and off of a gluten-free diet. I have gone so far as acupuncture to assist with proper digestion because I frequently find myself vomiting up undigested foods at least 7 to 9 hours after consuming them. I am 35 years old, a mother of five and a business owner of three. I do not consume sweets only because I have never taken a liking to them, I do not drink sodas, teas nor do I consume coffee. I also do not consume red meats and I am not a huge fan of vegetables. I have recently regurgitated a pile of blood and every time I eat anything, I am extremely bloated almost immediately. I am getting worried. Please suggest underlying potential issues that I should have tested with my local GP and specialists.","Hi.  To help you better, I need to have a look on your blood reports. Please attach them."
Q. Does the CBC report of elevated WBC and platelets mean leukemia?,"Hello doctor, About a month ago, I did a CBC for a regular check up. It came back as elevated WBC and platelets. It was 16.3. Neutrophils absolute 11.8, lymphâs absolute 3.5, platelets 402. Everything else was in normal range. I have had it done twice and it stayed about the same. I recently did an abdominal CT scan and it was normal. My doctor is going to do another CBC and if it is still elevated, she is going to send me to a specialist. I am extremely upset and worried. I have no symptoms. Does this mean I more than likely to have leukemia? I am a single mother and I am terrified. Could I please get a response?","Hello. Your platelet count is within normal limit. So do not worry about that. Your total count and neutrophils count is high. But your total count is not high enough to be labelled as leukemia. Usually such high count up to 20000 can be due to infection or any inflammation. So in such case, antibiotic course can be prescribed and repeated CBC after 10 days. However, if you can attach your reports then further comment can be given. Do not directly think about leukemia.In leukemia, total count is very high up to 1 lakh."
Q. I experience on and off acid reflux as well as mild dysphagia. Does it indicate esophageal cancer?,"Hello doctor,I am a 26-year-old male. I have been experiencing on and off acid reflux for a few weeks as well as mild dysphagia (strangely only at breakfast). I am afraid of esophageal cancer. I do not smoke and drink. I exercise regularly, and I am not overweight. I have no family history of any cancer. I do suffer from anxiety issues, though, and I have pollen allergies.","Hello. First, I would like to reassure you that dysphagia and reflux symptoms are very common and more common than esophageal cancer. I want to reassure you that this is very unlikely to be esophageal cancer. Esophageal cancer is more common in older patients who have a history of smoking and or alcohol abuse. In patients with reflux symptoms, those symptoms are usually longstanding, and progress to Barrett's esophagus before any cancer develops. I think that you have gastroesophageal reflux and I think your symptoms can be easily managed. 1. Start an over-the-counter reflux medication. I recommend Ranitidine 150 mg every 12 hours. It takes about 30 minutes to start working, and you can take this as soon as you get up in the morning. 2. Make sure to not eat for two to three hours before going to bed. 3. Avoid spicy or acidic foods, especially for breakfast when you complain you have the most symptoms. This would include avoiding ketchup, citric fruit juices, coffee, and tea. Try to eat a very bland diet for the next two to four weeks and see if that improves. Eggs and toast, for example, caffeine can cause acid, and so I recommend avoiding coffee and tea. If you must have it (as I can understand), try to wait until later in the morning and make sure that you have any coffee or tea with food (even just a dry piece of toast). If your symptoms have not improved in one month, you may need to see a gastroenterologist to be evaluated for esophagitis or an ulcer."
Q. I have a short penis and nightfall problem too. Is it normal?,"Hello, I am a 25 year old person.

I am an unmarried person, going to get married soon. So, will the penis size affect my marriage life? If so, I need a permanent solution for this. Kindly suggest meÂ medications with no side effects to solve this problem.","Hello. I hope, this will help you. Kindly follow up with a sexologist online -->"
Q. Does premature ejaculation occur due to masturbation habit?,"Hello doctor, I have a premature ejaculation problem. When I am doing foreplay with my girlfriend, it automatically gets ejaculated after four to five minutes. Is it due to my masturbation habit?","Hello. I can understand your concern. I have worked through your attached query in detail. Masturbation is not responsible for your symptoms. Masturbation has no evil effects on your sex life. Premature ejaculation will gradually subside in due course of time. In case if symptoms persist, few medications like Dapoxetine will help. Practicing sex regularly will help to overcome premature ejaculation. Anxiety. Performance anxiety. Premature ejaculation. Tablet Dapoxetine. Increasing foreplay."

Q. Why am I unable to protest verbally though I can?,"Hi doctor, My writing skill is very strong but verbally I cannot protest at all against difficult people. My verbal communication skill is proper and organized if and only if I am focused and conscious at that moment. Otherwise, I tend to be unprofessional and non-intelligent in speaking. Even when a friend illogically shouts over me, I cry over phone and still keep talking in gentle manner. My logic remains in my mind, but I just cannot speak out, which in turn disturbs me later. Sometimes, I get angry by thinking I could not stand verbally for myself at the right time. In the past I was taking Trinicalm plus. What is the problem? I have a feeling that either I am too gentle, less courageous, lack confidence or definitely soft natured and lack mental strength. Please help me.","Hi. Sometimes, it happens because of low self-esteem. Hence, you need to work on it. You need aversion therapy. You do not have to interfere in other's rights but, other side you have to stand for your rights. Do not be very cruel or too innocent, and then people will start teasing you. Remain in between. For some people who are having predicted behavior, you can prepare answer beforehand. So, you will get some self-confidence. Also, do not think too much about others. Forget everybody.

Q. What is the cause for toothache after eating?,"Hi doctor, I am a 23 year old female. Few weeks earlier, I had tooth pain after eating. Yesterday, I had acute pain in the tooth. I have attached the OPG scan for your reference. I would like to know, from the OPG, what is your opinion about the extent of decay? And also I would like to know about the possible diagnosis. Thank you.","Hi. Before I answer, I would like to point out a few issues here. You have not mentioned the location of your tooth pain, whether it is on the right or left side. The right and left indicator on the orthopantomograph (OPG) are not visible on the scanned image. So, I am going to describe the findings as I see it. To my right and left, I can see there is decay in two upper molar teeth. Upper third tooth from my right and the upper third tooth from my left.The decay in the upper right first molar appears to be deep. Depending on the symptoms, if you have acute pain that is unchanged, persistent and disturbs your sleep, then the tooth will require root canal treatment (RCT). This is because the nerve of the tooth (pulp) has been involved by the decay. If the RCT is started right away, the tooth can be saved. The decay in the upper left molar tooth is moderately deep and can be filled, if you get it done right away. If delayed, then the decay is likely to progress and involve the nerve of the tooth (pulp), then root canal treatment would be the only option to save the tooth."
Q. My left hip is completely fused. Can we have a healthy baby?,"Hi doctor, I have severe ankylosing spondylitis since 19 years. I am a 28 year old male, married and would like to have a baby now.

My wife is completely fine and healthy. I have attached my Hb, CRP and ESR reports. Please guide me.","Hi. Do not worry about your condition and your future baby. You are fine and your baby will also be fine, as genetic transmission is rare in this case. Again you should change the painkiller if you are not responding to it. You can start tablet Rofecoxib 50 mg daily for five days and let me know the condition of your pain. Apply Dolopar gel (Diclofenac) topically. Go for active physiotherapy exercises. Take a capsule Nutrolin B plus (multivitamin) daily for 15 days."
Q. Which tests should I do to check adrenal gland functions?,"Hi doctor, I am a 27 year old man and a student of ecological solution. I do a little bit of sport.Â I eat a balanced diet. I have fatigueÂ and headacheÂ when I do anaerobic exercise, and when I read a book. According to my doctor, my average blood pressure is 12.8 or 12.7. All my family members are in good health. My mother's sister has osteoporosis.Â Reading a book or something else gives me headache and fatigue, so I need to rest after reading something. When I need to read something I must drink a lot of water to be less tired, because if I do not drink a lot of water before reading I need to rest five times more than the usual. Because of this reason, I have stopped my schooling. I got my standard blood test, TSH and lipid test done, I used to do running of one hour by weekend. I want to do home body building like push-up, but I cannot do it like I used to do before.Â I do not know why my anaerobic capacity has decreased a lot in the last three years.Â When I do some push-ups or another anaerobic exercise like 100 m speed running, I have really bad results; I take too much time to do this kind of exercise. I am abnormally getting breathless and my heart beats fast. I was not like that before six years, but my physical appearance has not changed. I must drink 1 liter of water 35 minutes before running, if I do not then I cannot even stand for ten minutes.Â If I drink a lot of water like 1 liter, 40 minutes before, I can do 70 push-ups at the first series, but If I drink only one or two glasses of water 10 minutes before, I cannot do 45 push-ups and my heart begin to beat hard and I am completely breathless and tired. After a running session of 40 minutes to one hour, immediately when I begin to do my legs muscles stretching even if I am completely relaxed and feel good, without any breathlessness also. When I do my stretching my heart begins to beat very fast and hard and I begin to be breathless. Then I must wait and drink water and do my stretching very slowly. I have never felt this before, and I used to work at school with pleasure, read some books and do sport more easily.Â My wear has a strange smell after sport. It smells something like a rotten wood plank. It is a smooth bad odor not too much aggressive but really unusual. The few doctors I have seen do not know what the source of the problem is, but we found that I do not have a good thermoregulation because I am cold and need a lot of clothes. It seems like I feel better when I am in vasodilation period like under the sun or in a hot place. So, I tried a supplement called CitrullineÂ six months ago, to have more arginine in the body to have a better vasodilation. Indeed, I feel really less tired since I take the Citrulline. I feel like my muscle cells and other tissue are more supplied in something that I need in these cells.Â Citrulline helped a bit, but it did not resolve the problem. Hope you could help me. Thank you.","Hi. All your clinical problems appear to be related to anaerobic respiration. Based on your query, my opinion is as follows: For respiration, oxygen is most important - Anaerobic respiration mainly occurs because of reduced oxygen. You might require a lung function tests to evaluate for adequate oxygenation. If you are a smoker or exposed to pollution, dust or industrial exposure, it can get affected. Anemia requires evaluation. Hope your hemoglobin level is within normal limits. Get a hemogram done. Anaerobic respiration leads on to lactic acid production. This lactic acid accumulation causes muscle pain and tiredness. Do get your lactic acid accumulation level in blood evaluated before and after the exercise. Lactic acid level requires correlation with possible muscle storage disorders or dystrophies compared to exercise; there may be increased lactic acid production. Hydration would be washing of this lactic acid, which is possibly making you feel better. Meet a biochemist to get yourself tested for lactic acid increase and possible causes. Sweat glands can produce abnormal smell depending on diet. Look into your diet closely. Citrulline produces nitric oxide leading on to vasodilatation. It could be removing some amount of lactic acid or increasing oxygenation, but overall the main cause from lungs to blood and blood to muscle requires identification. Get the tests for hemoglobin level, lung function tests along with oxygen saturation and serum lactic acid. If all are normal, then muscle glycogen storage disorders or muscle biopsy for any pathology maybe necessary."

Q. Why do I get bleeding from the nose frequently?,"Hello doctor, I frequently get bleeding from the nose, but it does not create pain. But some times it flows from my nose automatically. What could it be?","Hello. Do you have any medical problems that we should know about? How old are you? Are you exposed to any environmental stimulants (irritating chemicals, etc.)? Most often, a bloody nose is not concerning, but it should be evaluated if it is happening regularly. How much blood is coming out? A teaspoon? Is it always one nostril? You can certainly start using a saline nasal spray three to four times a day in each nostril. You can also put some Vaseline in each nose before you go to sleep at night. However, if there are any other medical problems or anything concerning in your history, as I mentioned above, then you should be evaluated in person. You may need to see an ear, nose, and throat (E.N.T) doctor who can take a look in your nose and see if any blood vessels are prominent and can be treated with cautery. Or you may need to see your general medical doctor and have some blood work done, including a full blood count and platelet levels. Please let me know your answers to my questions, and hopefully, I can direct you further."

Q. I have Braxton Hicks at 27 weeks. Could I be in preterm?,"Hello doctor, I am 27 weeks pregnant and have had Braxton Hicks steady for two days with my back cramping and pressure in my bum and vagina. Could I be in preterm?","Hello. You have not mentioned your gynecological, obstetrics, menstrual and drug history. Have you previously had a normal delivery? If no, then the body prepares itself for normal vaginal delivery in the third trimester. In the first time mother, this process is long as it is happening for the first time. So, it takes more time than mothers who already had labor and normal delivery. Everyone's threshold for pain and body's reaction to late perineal changes in the third trimester and labor are different. Only mild cramps without severe contractions episodic going towards lower pelvis from the back are Braxton Hicks and it does not show labor changes in the cervix. Pressure symptoms, bladder heaviness, and recurrent urine are usual symptoms in the third trimester as the baby is mostly in cephalic presentation and growing size creates pressure in neighboring organs naturally. But precautions are necessary. It is better to differentiate between just Braxton Hicks and labor pains with cervical changes. Preterm delivery having lots of factors like infection, fetal, and maternal anomalies and diseases, rupture membranes, etc. Pain threshold relation to cervical changes is different for everyone. I cannot rule out that back cramping, the pressure in bum and vagina cannot lead to preterm delivery but there are factors behind that also that need to sort out. Otherwise, backache, pressure symptoms, mild labor like pains are normal symptoms in most of the women in late pregnancy. I hope you get my point. If there is a pain in the third trimester, we need to check with baby monitoring and mother's cervical changes with the strength of contractions. I hope u get my point. In case of labor-like frequent contractions, rupture of membranes and reduced fetal movements, you need to report to the hospital for monitoring and examination.

Q. I have a 4th nerve palsy issue and it scares me. Please help.,"Hello doctor, I am a 58-year-old cyclist. I recently started having a strange problem with my vision that started almost a month ago. It was also around the same time I was getting new glasses, but my optometrist said that he does not think the two are related. He referred me to see a neuro-ophthalmologist, and it looks like I have a 4th nerve palsy issue. After reading about it, it is familiar to my recent experiences. No accidents, history of diabetes or other issues. It seems to be my right eye. Looking straight, left and up is fine. The problem comes when looking down (bifocals) or looking right. I also read that blood flow could be an issue. I have been using my inversion table lately more often. I do feel obvious pressure in my eyes using this. Is that an issue? It scares me now, so I put it in the garage. I read this can be idiopathic and can even go away in a few months. Is it true?","Hello. The symptoms you are experiencing can all be in 4th nerve or superior oblique muscle palsy. This muscle acts to stabilize the eye when looking down and is the primary muscle acting while looking down and outwards. Since you mentioned that you do not have diabetes or other systemic illnesses, the cause could be idiopathic. Such idiopathic nerve palsies do have a good chance of improving on their own. The best sign to look for improvement is to see the double images moving closer to each other, and eventually disappear, on the complete resolution. In case you have any further questions or want any additional information, please let me know."

Q. Why is there pain in heart in a hypotensive patient?,"Hi doctor, I have low blood pressure and am suffering with low pain in the heart for the past two days.","Hi. We define low blood pressure if the reading is lower than 90 mm Hg systolic or 60 mm Hg diastolic or if the patient has symptoms which are lightheadedness, dizziness, fainting, blurred vision or lack of concentration. These symptoms are most prominent when individuals go from the lying or sitting position to the standing position. The causes of low blood pressure could be endocrine problems, dehydration, blood loss, severe infection (septicemia), severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis), or lack of nutrients in your diet. My advice to you is to eat a diet higher in salt, drink a lot of fluid especially in hot weather and while sick with a viral illness. And for your case, try to measure your blood pressure before and after taking normal saline. If there is no change, you can talk to an endocrine specialist. For more information consult an endocrinologist online -->"

Should I go for another HIV test or other STD tests?","Hi,  Welcome to icliniq.com. I have gone through the case. In my opinion, if you have no contact history for almost a year then there is no need to repeat all the tests.

Q. Why do I feel weak with low BP and inability to stand properly?,"Hello doctor, I am a 27-year-old man. Sometimes, I feel very weak. My BP goes down and I am unable to stand properly. Also, there is a pain in my foot. Please tell me the treatment to cover this type of problem.","Hello. You have two main concerns. The weakness is not due to low blood pressure. The low blood pressure can lead to dizziness and inability to stand as described by you. For that try to maintain hydration with lots of water and whenever you feel dizziness take salted food and fruit juices. You can check your blood sugar level as well. For tiredness, I suggest you investigate with serum potassium, serum sodium estimation, serum TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone) estimation, CBC (complete blood count), liver profile, and kidney profile. You can revert back with reports. For pain in the foot, avoid prolonged standing or walking. It is advisable to investigate with X-ray foot for further work up. You should get checked your serum calcium and vitamin D level as well."
"Q. Sometimes, I get palpitations, low BP and low sugar blackouts. Please advise.","Dear doctor, Sometimes I get low BP, low sugar blackouts and palpitations. Please advise.","Hi.

Mix one teaspoon of Electral powder (essential electrolytes) in a glass of water and drink thrice a day for a month. Low blood sugar and blackouts can occur if you do not eat your meals on time. Make sure you eat more frequent smaller meals, once in two hours. Alternatively, you can carry Hypotab tablets that contain a fixed dose of glucose. Pop it in when you feel a blackout coming. Palpitation can occur if your hemoglobin level is low. Include green leafy vegetables in your diet. If your blood counts are not good, you might need a supplement.

Q. Can long term usage of Ismo trigger low blood pressure and vertigo?,"Hello doctor, I am a 75-year-old male. I had IHD 40 years back. 23 years back, my doctor asked me to add Ismo 10 mg twice a day. Since then, I am taking it twice a day uninterruptedly. Then I was 54 years old. My BP has always been normal in all these years. Maybe 150/80 or 140/90 till a few years back. Now it is in normal level say 120/80, 120/73, 115/70, etc. Since a year, I am experiencing low blood pressure at times, giving me vertigo-like dizziness for 1 hour or 2 only in the early mornings and when I take Vertin, it subsides after 1 or 2 hours. Recently, I went to a well-known cardiologist in my area. He checked me and said that I have systemic hypertension and I need not take Ismo any longer as I do not need it. The BP at that time was 130/70. Before my going to the above cardiologist also I have experienced these levels like 120/70, 110/69, 125/75 likewise. He further said after stoppage of Ismo, the BP levels come to normal levels and I will not experience dizziness anymore. But, I am afraid of stopping the Ismo abruptly for fear of getting an anginal attack, which I have never experienced. I am afraid whether to ask my doctor about this. So, I have stopped taking one dose of Ismo 10 mg during the night. Slowly I shall stop the other doses also in due course. Kindly give me your valuable advice about Ismo, about stopping Ismo and dizziness. Is there any harm if I stop one dose? Does long usage of Ismo trigger low blood pressure and vertigo? Please enlighten me on this subject.","Hello. Firstly, Ismo (Isosorbide Mononitrate) is given for angina or chest pain. If one is not having it without Ismo then it may be stopped. So it is not an absolutely necessary medicine in absence of angina. Next thing, it can cause low BP, and low bp can cause dizziness. But, you mentioned, the lowest BP recorded was 110 systolic, and it is not too low to cause dizziness usually. Have you checked your BP while you being dizzy? So this BP can cause dizziness but not usually. Next thing, you said the response to Vertin (Betahistine), which is not likely in Ismo or hypotension induced dizziness. Vertin is for vertigo induced from the internal ear which is a very common problem. Also, importantly. dizziness induced by hypotension or Ismo will occur on standing or walking, but not while lying down or resting. So if it occurs on lying down as well or on neck movements then it is likely from the internal ear. Next, you should get one echo done to rule out the decrease in heart function as BP is remaining on the lower side. So overall, just go through the above description, and try to decide whether it is Ismo induced or from the internal ear, and you may stop Ismo as advised by the local cardiologist. Also, echo is necessary."
Q. I have low blood pressure. Kindly advise.,"Hello doctor, Is low blood pressure of 102/72 anything to worry about?","Hello. No, low blood pressure is not to be worried much but you should take little high protein diet and sodium diet.

Keep getting your blood parameters checked as it is beneficial for one to stay updated with your vital parameters."

Q. Will foreign bodies cause redness in eyes?,"Hello doctor, My eye has become red and is watering, I think a foreign object has entered but I am not able to find it. What should I do? It happened yesterday and icing did not help. Currently, I am under medication for high blood pressure.","Hi. First this to rule out is a foreign body in the eye. For that ask someone to examine your eye with a torchlight and also check the upper lid by everting it because that is the common site for foreign body. Sometimes a very small foreign body cannot be seen with the naked eye and need an eye exam by a doctor. Wash your eye with clean water. If there is no foreign body seen then it is most probably conjunctivitis (that presents with the same symptoms) usually viral conjunctivitis. It usually takes 7-10 days to complete recovery but during this period protect your other eye and other family members because it spreads from one person to another through contact. For symptomatic relief, keep washing your eyes with cold water and do icepacks. That helps to relieve discomfort. Start antibiotic (Moxifloxacin 0.5%) eye drops four times a day to avoid secondary infection. If pain and discomfort are severe consult your nearby eye doctor for a complete eye exam."

My concern is these rashes could be due to any viral or the possibility of allergy? Please suggest any test or treatment.","Hi. Probably may be a viral infection like hand foot and mouth disease.

Q. What causes palpitations and episodes of passing out for a few years?,"Hello doctor, I had palpitations and episodes of passing out on and off for a few years. I had blood, ultrasound, and ECG (electrocardiogram) tests done, and so far, I have no answers as what is causing it. Is there anything they can do to help the symptoms at this point or do I have to put up with it and hope they find a cause and treat.","Hello. The probable cause in you is a cardiac arrhythmia. Firstly, were these episodes witnessed by others? And I guess there are tonic clonic movements as seen in seizures. Also, any precipitating events like stress, urination or passing stool, etc., this is to rule out the possibility of vasovagal syncopes. So, considering the likely possibility of cardiac arrhythmia and recurrent syncopes, there is an option of electrophysiological studies which can answer the cause. Otherwise, we will have to wait and watch until the episode of arrhythmia recurs and captured on ILR (implantable loop recorder). But, if you are having symptoms at present and there is nothing on ILR, then it cannot be a cardiac arrhythmia. So, if you are symptoms at present, then ILR should be interrogated, and if asymptomatic, then electrophysiological studies is an option. Otherwise, wait and watch. I hope this helps you and get back if you have any doubts."
Q. Why am I having small red bumps on both sides of the bottom corners of my mouth?,"Hello doctor, I have small red bumps on both sides of the bottom corners of my mouth.

I have had this problem for six months and I have scheduled a visit with a dermatologist, but it will not be for a few months. I am not sure if this is relevant, but I work with pig guts, so, maybe I got something from them, but I am not sure since I have been working for almost five months before I got these symptoms. One thing I have noticed is that in the morning it looks like it has improved, but then by the end of the day it looks like it is back to normal. I am not sure what the problem is and am not sure if it can be treated without a prescription, but I am willing to try various things.",Hello. I understand your concern.

Use the following medications: Cream T-Bact (Mupirocin). Apply twice a day on the affected areas as well as the nasal vestibules which harbor the bacteria responsible for the recurrence. Do this for 10 days. Take care.
"Q. Followed by PMS, my period lasted for only two days. Is it worrisome?","Hi doctor, I am sexually active. But always use protection and double check after to see if the condom broke or not in case we need to take a pill. My period is fairly regular and lasts for 7 days. This time I did experience mild PMS symptoms and stomach cramps prior to onset. My period was five days earlier. And this time, period lasted for only two days but the flow was proper as always. Is there something I need to worry about?","Hello. Firstly, a single episode of early menstruation with normal flow does not qualify for being labeled as a case of polymenorrhea. Secondly, as you have been protected during intercourse, an implantation lasting for two complete days is also unlikely. So, you are pregnancy safe. Thirdly, the early withdrawal is likely to be stress induced hormonal imbalance especially progesterone level during this cycle which caused PMS (premenstrual syndrome) and menstrual cramps in this cycle. So, there is no actual need to be worried. Just maintain a menstrual calendar for next three months to understand the pattern of bleed. If the pattern continues then a hormonal profile and an ultrasound pelvis shall be required. But as of now, no intervention or investigation advised. Just increase your water intake and if not then try yoga and meditation which are great stress busters."

Q. What can cause weakness in postmenopausal period?,"Hi doctor, I have been in menopause for 6 years now. Over three months I have been having bouts of weakness in shoulders, arms and sides of stomach. I feel very weak and strange. I do not feel dizzy. Sometimes it starts with a hot flash. Or else I will stay awake with this terrible feeling and will have hot flash at the end of it. I had CBC. As my symptoms become worse I went to an urgent care and the doctor took 6 vials of blood. He checked many things including EKG, which is normal. My fasting finger prick was 74 and HbA1c 5.6. I have attached the rest of the blood reports.","Hi. I have gone through the details provided by you. All investigations are normal (attachment removed to protect patient identity) such as hemoglobin levels, non-diabetic, with normal resting EKG. So, these are not issue in your case. However, the following are the possibilities. Post menopausal hormone imbalances - You might have increased spurts of estrogen production which are causing the hot flashes. This is common in such menopausal age and requires only mild treatment if there is evidence of the increase. For this, get the following tests done - FSH (follicle stimulating hormone), LH (luteinizing hormone), estradiol and progesterone levels in blood. Hypertension - Get your BP monitored on daily basis at different times of the day and see if there is increase in levels at any point of time. This is again a reason for hot flashes, anger and weakness. It can be cured with mild medicine if found to be present. Check for your thyroid levels. Since you are overweight, there might be a possibility that you are suffering from hypothyroidism. Vitamin D3 levels - this is another reason for general weakness. Now if we go to further serious reasons, then one probability can be TIA (transient ischemic attack), there can be slight loss of blood supply to the brain which might be causing weakness in limbs. I am not sure if this would fit into you as coming to a conclusion requires medical examination which we cannot do online. I would suggest that you send us all reports as mentioned above and also go to a doctor to get full examination done. Only then we can comment on what is the right treatment in your case."
Q. Does the CBC test results of 2 years and 6 months old indicate something serious?,"Hello doctor, 2 years and 6 months old with abnormal CBC test results (two tests seven weeks apart). First tested because of enlarged lymph node (only one side) in neck. Node has reduced in size to what appears normal. Low MCHC (just barely outside range of 32.0 to 36.0) 31.3. Low NE % of 26.1 Auto diff with range 43.0 to 65.0, high LY % 62.7 with range 20.5 to 45.5, high EO % 3.9 with range .9 to 2.9. Highly # 6.2 with range of 1.0 to 5.5. What does this indicate? I have read all the horrible possibilities. Is it possible these are indicative of something not serious?","Hello. Your CBC report is suggestive of lymphocytosis (attachment removed to protect patient identity). The common cause for lymphocytosis is viral infection. The enlarged lymph node could be due to that. Now, your enlarged node return to normal size as per history, so suggestive of infective etiology. You might be feared about leukemia like condition. But in blood cancer, total count is very much high like more than 50000. So, it is not suggestive of blood cancer. However, if you have persistent lymphocytosis, then it is advisable to investigate with peripheral smear examination report for further work up. It will be able to help in identifying any abnormal cells, if present like atypical lymphocytes, blast, etc. You can consult your pediatrician for detailed physical examination."
Q. Can ALS cause muscle twitching?,"Hello doctor, My bicep muscle has been twitching and my leg and arms muscles twitch occasionally. I am super anxious about ALS. I am 36 and postpartum six weeks but I cannot stop obsessing about ALS. Please help.","Hello. I understand your concern and would explain that there are a lot of other benign causes that may lead to fasciculations like anxiety and insomnia, benign fasciculation syndrome, vitamin D and vitamin B12 deficiency, an electrolyte imbalance or thyroid gland dysfunction. For this reason, I would recommend performing some tests: Complete blood count, blood electrolytes, thyroid hormone levels, vitamin D and vitamin B12 plasma levels. Nerve conduction studies would help to definitely exclude ALS and put your mind to peace. You should discuss with your doctor on the above tests."

Q. I am suffering from mood swings. Kindly advice is this due to bipolar disorder.,"Hello doctor,I want to get some information regarding bipolar disorder because I think I have it. I had horrible mood swings, one moment I am overly happy, and the next moment I feel depressed. My sleeping schedule is also different than usual.","Hello. Let me answer your questions via some bullets some points to make things easier to understand. 1. You are only 14 years old, and it is very unusual for a significant mood disorder like bipolar mood disorder to manifest at such a young age. However, this does not mean it is impossible but just far less likely. 2. As a young woman at 14 years of age, it can be considered completely to have mood swings and sleep disruption due to premenstrual hormonal changes. Puberty, overall, is a time of huge biological and psychological change and is not uncommon for a person to experience broad mood changes within one day. 3. I feel your mood swings and general well being should have a keen eye kept on them. If you have a severe mental health disorder, it will become clear fairly soon. 4. From your point of view, as long as you are still able to function normally at school and keep up with your academics as well as maintain relatively good social interactions you are very likely not suffering from a severe mental illness like bipolar. Also, consider the extent of your inner sense of personal distress. Sometimes things can seem like the end of the world in puberty but are much less severe when viewed from a different perspective. 5. I think it would be wise if your parents could allow you to see a psychotherapist or counselor regularly going forward for you to unload your feelings in a safe and confidential environment. Also, such a person could keep an experienced eye on you, and if any severe psychiatric symptoms appear, they can be recognized and acted on it correctly. 6. So my final suggestion is to ask your parents if they are willing to help you find a suitably qualified psychologist and counselor that you can see regularly and feel you can trust them with your feelings. Remember if you are unsure about how you feel and if it is reasonable and not something to worry about, it is always better to speak up about how you think, just as you have done here. Should see a clinical psychologist or counsellor regularly."
Q. I am having swollen lymph node in my neck. Will it be painful after adjusting my neck?,"Hello doctor, I went to the chiropractor and got my neck adjusted. I had sore on my neck more in the back left corner then the pain passed down to my left arm. After checking, they said it was a flare-up and to ice it. The next day I had it adjusted again, and he pointed out that I had a swollen lymph node on the left side. I still had sore in the same spot and was worried about my artery and my lymph node. Could my lymph node be painful because they adjusted my neck or because my muscle was sore and irritated?","Hello. I do not think that because of chiropractor there will be any trouble to the lymph node. If the pain is radiating in nature, then it can be related to intervertebral disc injury which can be a past injury and due to which you had a sore neck. As the intervertebral discs are located in between the two vertebral bodies and the muscles are the supporting structures any trouble to the disc can first make the muscle sore and change the normal curvature of the cervical spine. The radiating symptoms can arise due to nerve root entrapment by the muscle as well as the intervertebral disc. Having an MRI scan of the cervical spine will be useful to avoid further injuries. Also, doing hot water fermentation will help to reduce the muscle spasm of the cervical spine region and the trapezius muscle by which the normal alignment of the cervical spine is achieved. Using cervical soft collar will help to reduce the mobility of the cervical spine leading to stabilization of the joints and less nerve root entrapment. Exercises like static neck exercises, shoulder stabilization exercises, interscapular muscle strengthening exercises will help to regain the muscle strength and correct the cervical spine alignment. If you have any more questions, you can ask me anytime."
Q. How good is Albenza for a raccoon roundworm exposure?,"Hello doctor,I am concerned about a possible raccoon roundworm exposure. I have read that I can take a prophylactic 10-day course of Albenza to keep any eggs from entering my CNS. I might have type 2 diabetes for a while and have put off bloodwork to find out. I am a glaucoma suspect based on the last eye exam. How hard is Albenza on the body? Is it generally well tolerated for many days? Do immediate side effects get better after a few days?","Hello. Albendazole 400 mg single star dose is enough for prophylactic deworming. 10 days course is not required. Usually, it is very safe and is well tolerated. A rare side effect is a seizure, that can happen if the worm is already lying dormant in your CNS. I generally prefer a three-day course of Mebendazole 100 mg twice daily as it does not enter CNS and so there are no changes of seizures. I hope it helps. If you have any further queries, please ask me."

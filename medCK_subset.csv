"Following endaerectomy on the right common carotid, a patient is found to be blind in the right eye. It is appears that a small thrombus embolized during surgery and lodged in the aery supplying the optic nerve. Which aery would be blocked?","The central aery of the retina is a branch of the ophthalmic aery. It is the sole blood supply to the retina; it has no significant collateral circulation and blockage of this vessel leads to blindness. The branches of this aery are what you view during a fundoscopic exam. Note: The infraorbital aery is a branch of the maxillary aery. It comes through the infraorbital foramen, inferior to the eye. It supplies the maxillary sinus, the maxillary incisors, canine and premolar teeth, and the skin of the cheek below the orbit. The supraorbital aery is another branch of the maxillary aery. It comes through the supraorbital foramen and supplies blood to the muscles, skin and fascia of the forehead. The lacrimal aery is a branch of the ophthalmic aery that supplies the lacrimal gland. The nasociliary aery doesn't exist, but there is a nasociliary nerve that travels with the ophthalmic aery. Ref: Moon D.A., Foreman K.B., Albeine K.H. (2011). Chapter 18. Orbit. In D.A. Moon, K.B.

The pharmakokinetic change occurring in geriatric patient is due to,"One of the most impoant pharmacokinetic changes associated with aging is decreased renal elimination of drugs. After age 40, creatinine clearance decreases an average of 8 mL/min/1.73 m2/decade; however, the age-related decrease varies substantially from person to person. Serum creatinine levels often remain within normal limits despite a decrease in GFR because older adults generally have less muscle mass and are generally less physically active than younger adults and thus produce less creatinine. Maintenance of normal serum creatinine levels can mislead clinicians who assume those levels reflect normal kidney function. Decreases in tubular function with age parallel those in glomerular function. Refer katzung 11/e p1039",Anatomy,General anatomy,Renal clearance

A 60 yr old chronic smoker presents with painless gross hematuria of 1 day duration. Investigation of choice to know the cause of hematuria,"Urine microscopy for malignant cytology ""Painless haematuria is by far the most common symptom of bladder cancer and should be regarded as indicative of a bladder carcinoma until proven otherwise."" Bailey & Love 25/e p1336 (24/e p1363) Cigarette smoking is the main etiological factor and accounts ,for about 50% of bladder cancers Among the given options 'urine microscopy' is the best choice for investigating a pt. with high suspicion for bladder ca. This is not a good screening test but a positive result is highly specific. The best investigation would be cystoscopy & biopsy. Investigations for bladder cancer 1. Urinary cytology - Exfoliated cells from both normal and neoplastic urothelium can be readily identified in voided urine. Examination of cytological specimens can detect the malignant cells either at the time of initial presentation or during follow-up. Cytological examination may be especially useful in screening high-risk population and assessing the response to treatment. 2. Cystourethroscopy and tumor resection - The diagnosis and initial staging of bladder cancer is made by cystoscopy and transurethral resection. 3.Imaging (IVP, CT, MRI) - Although various imaging techniques can detect bladder cancer, its presence is confirmed by cystoscopy & biopsy. - Therefore imaging modalities are used to image the upper urinary tract and, when infiltrating bladder tumors are detected to assess the depth of muscle wall infiltration and the presence of local & distant metastasis. - Intravenous urography remains one of the most common imaging tests for the evaluation of hematuria. However, intravenous pyelography is increasingly being replaced by computed tomography (CT) urography, which is more accurate, for evaluation of the entire abdominal cavity, renal parenchyma, and ureters in patients with hematuria. Bladder tumors may be recognized as pedunculated, radiolucent filling defects projecting into the lumen; nonpapillary, infiltrating tumors may result in fixation or flattening of the bladder wall. 4. Urinary tumor markers - - Several new tests have been developed in order to overcome the shocomings of urinary cytology such as the low sensitivity for low-grade superficial tumors and inter-observer variability. - Commercially available tests include, the BTA test, the BTA stat test, the BTA TRAK assay determination of urinary nuclear matrix protein (NMP22), Immunocyt and UroVysion . - These tests can detect cancer specific proteins in urine (BTA/NMP22) or augment cytology by identifying cell surface or cytogenetic markers in the nucleus. Other tests under investigation include identification of the Lewis X antigen on exfoliated urothelial cells, and the determination of telomerase activity in exfoliated cells. - These tests have been demonstrated to enhance detection of bladder cancer when used either individually or in combination with cytology. They have been used to detect both new index tumors as well as recurrent tumors.",Surgery,,Urine microscopy for malignant cytology cells

Atherosclerosis initiation by fibroblast plaque is mediated by injury to ?,"Ans. is 'd' i.e., Endothelium The most acceptable hypothesis for the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis is ""the response to injury hypothesis"". According to this hypothesis, atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory response of the aerial wall initiated by injury to endothelium. Pathogenesis of atherosclerosis Following stages occurs in the pathogenesis of Atherosclerosis: Endothelial injury Earliest stages of the development of atherosclerosis are mediated by the inflammatory cascade. Inflammation mediated injury to endothelium is the cornestone in the development of atherosclerosis. After injury, endothelium is activated and there is increased expression of adhesion molecule-VCAM-1 and there is increased permeability to endothelium. TNF is the major cytokine to induce this expression. Migration of leukocytes When VCAM-1 is expressed on endothelium, leukocytes adhere to the endothelium. Leukocytes than cross the endothelial barrier and begin to accumulate in subendothelial intimal space. Macrophages engulf LDL cholesterol and form foam cells - formation of earliest lesion, i.e. fatty streak. Macrophages also form oxygen free radicals that cause oxidation of LDL to yield oxidized LDL (modified LDL). Smooth muscle cell migration and proliferation Inflammatory cells in subendothelial intimal space secrete cytokines, mainly PDGF, TGF-ct and FGF which cause migration of smooth muscle cells from media to subendothelial intimal space as well as their proliferation. Maturation of plaque Smooth muscle cells synthesize extracellular matrix (especially collegen) and conve a fatty streak into a mature fibrofatty atheroma, and contribute to the progressive growth of atherosclerotic lesions.",Pathology,,Endothelium

Phagocytosis by Macrophages.
Macrophages are the end-stage product of monocytes that enter the tissues from the blood. When activated by the immune system, they are much more powerful phagocytes than neutrophils, often capable of phagocytizing as many as 100 bacteria. They also have the ability to engulf much larger particles, even whole RBCs or, occasionally, malarial parasites, whereas neutrophils are not capable of phagocytizing particles much larger than bacteria. Also, after digesting particles, macrophages can extrude the residual products and often survive and function for many more months.

Earliest lesion seen in atherosclerosis is:,"Ans: A (Fatty streaks) Ref: Robbins Pathologic Basis of Disease, 8th edition.Explanation:Fatty streaks are the earliest lesions in atherosclerosis "" Ref: RobbinsMorphology of AtherosclerosisFatty StreaksThese are the earliest lesions in atherosclerosis.They are composed of lipid-filled foamy macrophages.Beginning as multiple minute flat yellow spots, they eventually coalesce into elongated streaks 1 cm or more in length.These lesions are not significantly raised and do not cause any flow disturbanceAortas of infants less than 1 year old can exhibit fatty streaks, and such lesions are seen in virtually all children older than 10 years, regardless of geography, race, sex, or environment.The relationship of fatty streaks to atherosclerotic plaques is uncertainThey may evolve into precursors of plaques, not all fatty streaks are destined to become advanced lesions.Atherosclerotic PlaqueThe key processes in atherosclerosis are intimal thickening and lipid accumulationAtheromatous plaques impinge on the lumen of the artery and grossly appear white to yellow: superimposed thrombus over ulcerated plaques is red-brown.Plaques vary from 0.3 to 1.5 cm in diameter but can coalesce to form larger massesAtherosclerotic lesions are patchy, on cross- section, the lesions appear ""eccentric""Local flow disturbances (e.g., turbulence at branch points) leads to increased susceptibility to plaque formation.In descending order, the most extensively involved vessels are theLower abdominal aorta (MC)The coronary arteries (Second MC)The popliteal arteriesThe internal carotid arteriesVessels of the circle of WillisVessels of the upper extremities are usually spared, as are the mesenteric and renal arteries, except at their ostia.Atherosclerotic plaques have three principal components:Cells, including smooth muscle cells, macrophages, and T cellsECM, including collagen, elastic fibers, and proteoglycansIntracellular and extracellular lipidSuperficial fibrous cap composed of smooth muscle cells and dense collagen.Beneath and to the side of the cap (the ""shoulder"") is a more cellular area containing macrophages, T cells, and smooth muscle cells.Deep to the fibrous cap is a necrotic core, containing lipid (primarily cholesterol and cholesterol esters), debris from dead cells, foam cells (lipid-laden macrophages and smooth muscle cells), fibrin, variably organized thrombus, and other plasma proteins and cholesterolThe periphery of the lesions show neovascularization (proliferating small blood vessels;Plaques generally continue to change and progressively enlarge due to cell death and degeneration, synthesis and degradation (remodeling) of ECM, and organization of thrombus.Atheromas often undergo calcificationAtherosclerotic plaques are susceptible to the following clinically important changes* Rupture, ulceration, or erosion of the intimal surface of atheromatous plaques exposes the blood to highly thrombogenic substances and induces thrombosis.* Such thrombosis can partially or completely occlude the lumen and lead to downstream ischemia.* If the patient survives the initial thrombotic occlusion, the clot may become organized and incorporated into the growing plaque.* Hemorrhage into a plaque. Rupture of the overlying fibrous cap, or of the thin-walled vessels in the areas of neovascularization, can cause intra-plaque hemorrhage; a contained hematoma may expand the plaque or induce plaque rupture.* Atheroembolism.

When the concentration of LDH-1 is observed to be greater than LDH2. It is referred to as flipped LDH and is indicative of Myocardial infarction. LDH has five isoenzymes: LDH-1 LDH-1 is found primarily in hea muscle 17% to 27% LDH-2 LDH-2 is primarily found in Red blood cells 27% to 37% LDH-3 LDH-3 is highest in the lung 18% to 25% LDH-4 LDH-4 is highest in the kidney, placenta, and pancreas 3% to 8% LDH-5 LDH-5 is highest in the liver and skeletal muscle 0% to 5% The LDH test helps determine the location of tissue damage.

Which of the following is not a component of transpo system?,"Functions: Transpo Systems An essential role of biomembranes is to allow movement of all compounds necessary for the normal function of a cell across the membrane barrier. These compounds include a vast array of substances like sugars, amino acids, fatty acids, steroids, cations and anions to mention a few. These compounds must enter or leave the cells in an orderly manner for normal functioning of the cell. A. 1. Ion Channels Ion channels are transmembrane channels, pore-like structures composed of proteins. Specific channels for Na+, K+, Ca++, and Cl- have been identified. Cation conductive channels are negatively charged within the channel and have an average diameter of about 5 to 8 nm. All ion channels are basically made up of transmembrane subunits that come together to form a central pore through which ions pass selectively. All channels have gates and are controlled by opening and closing. Types of Gates Two types of gated channels. They are a. Ligand-gated channels: In this, a specific molecule binds to a receptor and opens the channel. Example: Acetylcholine receptor is present in the postsynaptic membrane. It is a complex of five subunits, having a binding site for acetylcholine. Acetylcholine released from the presynaptic region binds with the binding site of the postsynaptic region, which triggers the opening of the channel and influx of Na+. b. Voltage-gated channels: These channels open or close in response to changes in membrane potential. Some propeies of ion channels * Composed of transmembrane protein subunits. * Highly selective. * Well regulated by the presence of ""gates"". * Two main types of gates: Ligand-gated and voltage-gated. * Activities are affected by ceain drugs. * Mutations of genes encoding transmembrane proteins can cause specific diseases. 2. Ionophores Ceain microorganisms can synthesize small organic molecules, called ionophores, which function as shuttles for the movement of ions across the membrane. Structure: These ionophores contain hydrophilic centres that bind specific ions and are surrounded by peripheral hydrophobic regions. Types: Two types: (a) Mobile ion carriers: Like valinomycin (Refer uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation). (b) Channel formers: Like gramicidin. 3. Water Channels (Aquaporins) In ceain cells, e.g. in red blood cells, and cells of the collecting ductules of the kidney, the movement of water by simple diffusion is enhanced by movements of water through water channels, composed of tetrameric transmembrane proteins called aquaporins. About five distinct types of aquaporins have been recognised. CLINICAL ASPECT Recently mutations in the gene encoding AP-2 (Aquaporin 2) protein, have been shown to be the cause of one type of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. 4. Gap Junction Ceain cells develop specialized regions on their membranes for intercellular communications which are in close proximity. Function: They mediate and regulate the passage of ions and small molecules upto 1000 to 2000 mol wt, through a narrow hydrophilic core connecting the cytosol of adjacent cells. Structure: They are primarily composed of protein, called connexon which contains four membrane-spanning a-helices. the mitochondrial membrane also has paicularly energy coupling mechanism.Ref: MN Chatterjea Textbook of Medical Biochemistry, 8th edition",Biochemistry,Respiratory chain,Receptor activation
Burst supression pattern on EEG is typically seen in:,"Ref: Ref: Harrisons 18/e p e-45 chapter
 As the depth of coma increases, the EEG becomes nonreactive and may show a burst-suppression pattern, with bursts of mixed-frequency activity separated by intervals of relative cerebral inactivity. In other instances there is a reduction in amplitude of the EEG until eventually activity cannot be detected. Such electrocerebral silence does not necessarily reflect irreversible brain damage, because it may occur in hypothermic patients or with drug overdose.
The prognosis of electrocerebral silence, when recorded using an adequate technique, depends upon the clinical context in which it is found. In patients with severe cerebral anoxia, for example, electrocerebral silence in a technically satisfactory record implies that useful cognitive recovery will not occur.",Unknown,,Anoxic encephalopathy

Which of the following is the most specific and sensitive screening test for renovascular hypeension?,"Hypeension due to an occlusive lesion of a renal aery is renovascular hypeensionIn the initial stages, the mechanism of hypeension generally is related to activation of the renin-angiotensin system. Obstruction of the renal aery leads to decreased renal perfusion pressure, thereby stimulating renin secretion. Over time, possibly as a consequence of secondary renal damage, this form of hypeension may become less renin-dependent.As a screening test, renal blood flow may be evaluated with a radionuclide -ohoiodohippurate (OIH) scan, or glomerular filtration rate may be evaluated with a - diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA) scan before and after a single dose of captopril (or another ACE inhibitor).Contrast aeriography remains the ""gold standard"" for evaluation and identification of renal aery lesions.Harrison 19e pg: 1618",Medicine,All India exam,CT Angiography

"A 63 year old man presents with a triad of angina, syncope and congestive hea failure. Which of the following valvular hea lesion can be suspected-","Even severe AS may exist for many years without producing any symptoms because of the ability of the hyperophied LV to generate the elevated intraventricular pressures required to maintain a normal stroke volume. Most patients with pure or predominant AS have gradually increasing obstruction over years, but do not become symptomatic until the sixth to eighth decades. Exeional dyspnea, angina pectoris, and syncope are the three cardinal symptoms. Dyspnea results primarily from elevation of the pulmonary capillary pressure caused by elevations of LV diastolic pressures secondary to reduced left ventricular compliance and impaired relaxation. Angina pectoris usually develops somewhat later and reflects an imbalance between the augmented myocardial oxygen requirements and reduced oxygen availability. Exeional syncope may result from a decline in aerial pressure caused by vasodilation in the exercising muscles and inadequate vasoconstriction in nonexercising muscles in the face of a fixed CO, or from a sudden fall in CO produced by an arrhythmia.

A patient with cushinoid features presents with hemoptysis; he shows no response to dexamethasone suppression test; most likely diagnosis here is:,Answer is C (Ca lung with ectopic ACTH production); Lack of suppression to dexamethasone challenge (ACTH producing tumor) and presence of hemoptysis (Carcinoma lung) in a patient with Cushinoid features suggests a diagnosis of Carcinoma lung with ectopic ACTH secretion. As a method of diagnostic workup of any patient with suspected Cushings we screen the patient with plasma coisol levels at 8:00 a.m. in the morning. Those with increased coisol levels are subjected to a dexamethasone supression test. In the given question there is lack of suppression to dexamethasone challenge so option (d) is out.

Mediastinal lymph node calcification is seen in which one of the following-,"Ref:Robbins Basic Pathology (9th Edition),page no.478,479 Sarcoidosis Although sarcoidosis is considered here as an example of a restrictive lung disease, it is impoant to note that sarcoidosis is a multisystem disease of unknown etiology characterized by noncaseating granulomas in many tissues and organs. MORPHOLOGY The diagnostic histopathologic feature of sarcoidosis is the noncaseating epithelioid granuloma, irrespective of the organ involved. This is a discrete, compact collection of epithelioid cells rimmed by an outer zone of largely CD4+ T cells. The epithelioid cells are derived from macrophages and are characterized by abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and vesicular nuclei. It is not uncommon to see intermixed multinucleate giant cells formed by fusion of macrophages. A thin layer of laminated fibroblasts is present peripheral to the granuloma; over time, these proliferate and lay down collagen that replaces the entire granuloma with a hyalinized scar. Two other microscopic features are sometimes seen in the granulomas: (1) Schaumann bodies, laminated concretions composed of calcium and proteins; and (2) asteroid bodies, stellate inclusions enclosed within giant cells. Their presence is not required for diagnosis of sarcoidosis--they also may occur in granulomas of other origins. Rarely, foci of central necrosis may be present in sarcoid granulomas, suggesting an infectious process. Caseation necrosis typical of tuberculosis is absent The lungs are involved at some stage of the disease in 90% of patients. The granulomas predominantly involve the interstitium rather than air spaces, with some tendency to localize in the connective tissue around bronchioles and pulmonary venules and in the pleura (""lymphangitic"" distribution). The bronchoalveolar lavage fluid contains abundant CD4+ T cells. In 5% to 15% of patients, the granulomas eventually are replaced by diffuse interstitial fibrosis, resulting in a so-called honeycomb lung. Intrathoracic hilar and paratracheal lymph nodes are enlarged and calcification in 75% to 90% of patients, while a third present with peripheral lymphadenopathy. The nodes are characteristically painless and have a firm, rubbery texture. Unlike in tuberculosis, lymph nodes in sarcoidosis are ""nonmatted"" (nonadherent) and do not ulcerate.",Pathology,Respiratory system,Sarcoidosis

Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease features include:,"Ans. A. Can be diagnosed intrauterineExplanationClinical features of ARPKD (Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease) are:Classic ARPKD is generally diagnosed in utero or within the neonatal period and characterized by greatly enlarged echogenic kidneys in diseased fetuses. (Option a)Reduced fetal urine production may contribute to oligohydramnios and pulmonary hypoplasia.About 30% of affected neonates die shortly after birth due to respiratory insufficiency. Close to 60% of mortality occurs within the first month of life.In the classic group, most patients are bom with renal insufficiency and ESRD (End stage renal disease). (Option b)However, infants often have a transient improvement in their GFR; death from renal insufficiency at this stage is rare.Some patients are diagnosed after the neonatal stage and form the older group. Morbidity and mortality in this group often involve systemic hypertension, progressive renal insufficiency, and liver manifestations.The hallmarks of ARPKD liver disease are biliary dysgenesis due to a primary ductal plate malformation with associated periportal fibrosis, namely congenital hepatic fibrosis (CHF) and dilatation of intrahepatic bile ducts (Caroli's disease). CHF and Caroli's disease can then lead to portal hypertension exhibiting hepatosplenomegaly, variceal bleeding, and cholangitis.Some patients with the diagnosis of ARPKD at 1 year of age with nephromegaly exhibit slowly declining renal function over 20 years with only minimally enlarged kidneys at ESRD (Option c and e) and markedly atrophic kidneys following renal transplantation.The slow progression of renal disease is likely due to increasing fibrosis rather than the development of cysts.Systemic hypertension is common in all ARPKD patients, even those with normal renal function.

No mucosal ulceration is seen.","Gastritis is a nonspecific term that describes any inflammation of the gastric mucosa. Acute gastritis refers to the clinical situation of gastric mucosal erosions (not mucosal ulcers). Acute gastritis is also known as hemorrhagic gastritis or acute erosive gastritis. Acute gastritis is associated with the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as aspirin, ibuprofen, and coicosteroids, and also with alcohol, chemotherapy, ischemia, shock, and even severe stress. Two types of stress ulcers are Curling's ulcers, seen in patients with severe burns, and Cushing's ulcers, seen in patients with intracranial lesions. Grossly acute gastritis appears as multiple, scattered, punctate (less than 1 cm) hemorrhagic areas in the gastric mucosa. This is helpful in differentiating acute gastritis from peptic ulcers, which tend to be solitary and larger.

Iliac crest involvement is common in which condition: March 2007,"Ans. A: Ankylosing Spondylitis The basic pathologic lesion of ankylosing spondylitis occurs at the entheses, which are sites of attachment to bone of ligaments, tendons, and joint capsules. Enthesopathy results from inflammation, with subsequent calcification and ossification at and around the entheses. Inflammation with cellular infiltration by lymphocytes, plasma cells, and polymorphonuclear leukocytes is associated with erosion and eburnation of the subligamentous bone. The process usually stas at the sacroiliac joints. Other enthesopathic sites include the iliac crest, ischial tuberosity, greater trochanter, patella, and calcaneum. Ankylosing spondylitis/ AS/ Bechterew's disease/ Bechterew syndrome/ Marie Strumpell disease/Spondyloahritis is a chronic, painful, degenerative inflammatory ahritis primarily affecting spine and sacroiliac joints, causing eventual fusion of the spine. AS is a systemic rheumatic disease and one of the seronegative spondyloahropathies. About 90% of the patients express the HLA-B27 genotype. Men are affected more than women by a ratio in excess of 10:1. Typical signs of progressed AS are the visible formation of syndesmophytes on X-rays and abnormal bone outgrowths similar to osteophytes affecting the spine. Complete fusion results in a complete rigidity of the spine, a condition known as bamboo spine. In 40% of cases, ankylosing spondylitis is associated with iridocyclitis causing eye pain and photophobia. 4.1 AS is also associated with ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, psoriasis, and Reiter's disease Other complications are aoic regurgitation, Achilles tendinitis, AV node block and amyloidosis & restrictive lung disease.

The number of ATPs generated in krebs cycleare ?,"Ans. is 'b' > b' i.e., 24 One turn of the TCA cycle, staing with acetyl CoA produces 10 ATPs. When the staing molecule is pyruvate, the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate, the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate yields 2.5 ATPs and therefore, 12.5 ATPs are produced when staing compound is pyruvate. Since, two molecules of pyruvate enter the TCA cycle when glucose is metabolized (glycolysis produces 2 molecules of pyruvate), the number of ATPs is doubled. Therefore, 25 ATP molecules, per glucose molecule, are produced when pyruvate enters the TCA cycle.Note : Previously calculations were made assuming that NADH produces 3 ATPs and FADH generates 2 ATPs. This will amount a net generation of 30 ATP molecules in TCA per molecule glucose and total 38 molecules from staing. Recent experiments show that these values are overestimates and NADH produces 2.5 ATPs and FADH produces 1.5 ATPs. Therefore, net generation during TCA is 25 ATPs and complete oxidation of glucose through glycolysis plus citric acid cycle yield a net 32 ATPs.Energy yield (number of ATP generated) per molecule of glucose when it is completely oxidized through glycolysis plus citric acid cycle, under aerobic conditions, is as follows :- Method ofNo of ATPsNo of ATPsPathwayStepEnzymeSource ATP formationgained perglucose(new calculation)As per oldcalculationGlycolysis1Hexokinase MinusMinus 1Do3Phosphofructokinase MinusMinus 1Do5Glyceraldehyde-3-p DHNADH Respiratory chain2.5 x 2 = 53 x 2 = 6Do61,3-BPGkinase ATPSubstrate level1 x 2 -- 21 x 2 = 2Do9Pyruvate kinaseATP Substrate level1 x 2 = 21 x 2 = 2Pyruvate to?PyruvateNADH Respiratory chain2.5x2= 53x2= 6Acetyl CoA Dehydrogenase TCA cycle3Isocitrate DHNADH Respiratory chain2.5x2= 53 x 2= 6Do4Alpha keto glutarate DHNADH Respiratory chain2.5x2= 53x2= 6Do5Succinate thiokinaseGTP Substrate level1 x 2 = 21 x 2 = 2Do6Succicinate DHFADH2Respiratory chain1.5x2= 32 x 2= 4Do8Malate DHNADH Respiratory chain2.5x2= 53 x 2= 6Net generation in glycolytic pathway 9 minus 2= 7 10 minus 2= 8Generation in pyruvate dehydrogenase reaction 5 * 6Generation in citric acid cycle 20 * 24Net generation of ATP from one glucose mole 32 * 38",Biochemistry,,24

"A female child with virilization, hypertension with low plasma renin diagnosis is :","9] Congenital adrenal hyperplasia represents a group of autosomal recessive inherited, metabolic errors,
each characterized by decency or total lack of a particular enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of cortical steroids,
Steroidogenesis is then channelled into other pathways leading to increased production of androgens,
which accounts for virilization.
Simultaneously, the decency of cortisol results in increased secretion of ACTH resulting in adrenal hyperplasia.
Following enzymes are implicated in the congenital adrenal hyperplasia 21 α hydroxylase decency (partial or complete) 17 α hydroxylase deficiency 11β hydroxylase
deficiency 21 α hydroxylase deficiency
• Two forms of this deficiency include -
A. Salt-wasting adrenogenital ism
B. Simple Virilizing adrenogenital ism
A) Salt-wasting syndrome (complete lack) The salt wasting syndrome results from complete lack of 21 hydroxylases.
There is no synthesis of mineralocorticoids and glucocorticoids in the adrenal cortex.
Decreased mineralocorticoids causes marked sodium loss in the urine, resulting in hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, acidosis and hypotension.
Because of the enzyme block, there is increased formation of 17 - hydroxyprogesterone, which is then shunted into the production of testosterone.
This may cause virilism (pseudo-hermaphroditism) in female infants.
That is (XX) Female with 21 hydroxylase deficiency develops ovaries,
female ductal structures and external male genitalia. But in the male child, the effect of increased testosterone will not be manifested at the time of birth.
The complete21 hydroxylase deficiency or salt wasting syndrome usually comes to light only after the birth because in utero the electrolytes and uids
can be maintained by maternal kidneys. Males with this disorder comes to clinical attention 5 to 15 days later because of salt losing crisis while
females come to attention soon after the birth because of the virilization.
B) Simple Virilizing adrenogenital syndrome (Partial deficiency) Occurs in individuals
with partial deficiency of 21 hydroxylases Less severe deficiency of mineralocorticoid, is sufficient for salt reabsorption, but the lowered glucocorticoid fails to cause
feedback inhibition of ACTH secretion.
Thus level of aldosterone is mildly reduced, testosterone is increased and ACTH elevated with resultant adrenal hyperplasia.
11B hydroxylase deficiency-. Rare Leads to decreased cortisol and increased ACTH.
This, in turn, leads to the accumulation of DOC (deoxycorticosterone) and 11 deoxycortisol
both of which are strong mineralocorticoids. This results in increased sodium retention by the kidneys and hypertension, hypokalemia.
Patients also develop virilization due to androgen excess. 17 α hydroxylase deficiency - Patients with deficiency of 17 hydroxylases also have impaired cortisol production,
increased ACTH and secondary increased DOC.
These patients, however, cannot synthesize normal amount of androgens and estrogens.
This is because the gene that codes for 17 α hydroxylase is the same for the enzyme in the adrenal cortex and the gonads and the decency is same in both organs.
Because of decreased sex hormones, genotypic females develop primary amenorrhoea and fail to develop secondary sex characteristics while genotypic
males will present as pseudohermaphrodite.
3 β hydroxylase deficiency 3-β hydroxylase deficiency is a rare genetic disorder of steroid biosynthesis that results
in decreased production of all three groups of adrenal steroids which include mineralocorticoid, glucocorticoid and sex steroids.
Decreased mineralocorticoid secretion
results in varying degrees of salt wasting in both males and females.
Decent androgen production results in ambiguous genitalia in males
The usual presentation is a male child with ambiguous genitalia and severe salt wasting. Sometimes it may also occur in females",Medicine,,11 β hydroxylase deficiency

All the teeth in patient’s mouth are similarly affected as shown in the radiograph. What is the most likely anomaly?,"Dentinal dysplasia
Dentinal dysplasia is an inherited condition affecting both dentitions. It is divided into two types: Type I (radicular dentinal dysplasia) and Type II (coronal dentinal dysplasia). It occurs less frequently than dentinogenesis imperfecta.
Clinical features
Type I is the more frequent type. Teeth erupt normally with no obvious abnormality but rapidly develop mobility resulting from limited root support. In type II, the deciduous teeth are similar to those in dentinogenesis imperfecta, whereas the permanent teeth appear normal.
Radiological signs
In Type I, all the teeth, except the canines, have extremely short roots. The roots are conical or blunted. There is pulpal obliteration and the inferior aspects of the crown exhibit linear crescent-shaped radiolucent lines. Periapical radiolucencies are commonly seen associated with non-carious teeth in Type I dentinal dysplasia. In Type II dentinal dysplasia, obliteration of the pulp occurs post eruption in the deciduous dentition. In the permanent dentition, there is alteration in the configuration of the pulp resulting in enlarged pulp chambers extending well down into the root. The pulp contains multiple calcifications.

"Most serious complication seen in other eye after traumatic injury to one eye: March 2005, September 2008","Ans. C: Sympathetic ophthalmia Sympathetic ophthalmia (SO) is a condition in which serious inflammation attacks the sound eye after injury (including intraocular surgeries) to the other. It is the most dreaded complication of unilateral severe eye injury, as it can leave the patient completely blind. Symptoms may develop from days to several years after a penetrating eye injury. Sympathetic ophthalmia is thought to be an autoimmune inflammatory response toward ocular antigens, specifically a delayed hypersensitivity to melanin-containing structures from the outer segments of the photoreceptor layer of the retina. It is thought that Louis Braille, who injured his left eye as a child, lost vision in his right eye due to SO Floating spots and loss of accommodation are among the earliest symptoms. The disease may progress to severe iridocyclitis with pain and photophobia. Commonly the eye remains relatively painless while the inflammatory disease spreads through the uvea. The retina, however, usually remains uninvolved. Papilledema, secondary glaucoma, vitiligo and poliosis of the eyelashes may accompany SO. Diagnosis is clinical, seeking a history of eye injury. An impoant differential diagnosis is Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome (VKH), which is thought to have the same pathogenesis, without a history of surgery or penetrating eye injury. Definitive prevention of SO requires prompt (within the first 7 to 10 days following injury) enucleation of the injured eye. Evisceration--the removal of the contents of the globe while leaving the sclera and extraocular muscles intact--is easier to perform, offers long-term orbital stability, and is more aesthetically pleasing. But evisceration may lead to a higher incidence of SO compared to enucleation. Immunosuppressive therapy is the mainstay of treatment for SO. When initiated promptly following injury, it is effective in controlling the inflammation and improving the prognosis.",Ophthalmology,,Sympathetic ophthalmia

Post traumatic stress disorder is differentiated from other anxiety disorders by which of the following symptoms?,"This question is not about the diagnostic features of PTSD. This is about the differential diagnosis. PTSD is an anxiety disorder and it shares symptoms with other disorders. Impoant features in distinguishing the condition are given below. Differential diagnosis: Point 1: Etiologically significant trauma should be present for a diagnosis of PTSD. E.g. A traumatic event in the past. Point 2: 'Intentionality' or 'aboutness' is an impoant factor for PTSD. Nightmares, flashbacks or reliving experiences should be related to the past event. PTSD concerns memory - Intrusion of past stressors into the present. Point 3: Avoid a 'stimulus' or 'activity' that provokes the memory of the past event. In the above question, only reliving experience is mentioned as connected to the past experiences. Hence, that is the answer for this question.

Which of the following nerve is involved in Frey's syndrome?,"Syndrome (Gustatory Sweating) aka auriculotemporal syndrome: Frey's syndrome arises as a complication of parotid surgery usually manifesting several months after the operation. lt is characterised by sweating and flushing of the preauricular skin during mastication causing nuisance to the person or social embarrassment. It is the result of damage to auriculotemporal nerve and aberrant innervation of sweat glands by parasympathetic secretomotor fibres which were destined for the parotid. Now instead of causing salivary secretion from the parotid, they cause secretion from the sweat glands. The condition can be treated by tympanic neurectomy which intercepts these parasympathetic fibres at the level of middle ear. Some people like to place a sheet of fascia lata between the skin and the underlying fat to prevent secretomotor fibres reaching the sweat glands. Generally, no treatment other than reassurance is required in most of these patients. Also known as Crocodile tears (gustatory lacrimation): There is unilateral lacrimation with mastication. This is due to faulty regeneration of parasympathetic fibres which now supply lacrimal gland instead of the salivary glands. It can be treated by section of greater superficial petrosal nerve or tympanic neurectomy.",Surgery,,Ariculo temporal

Enterobius commonly inhabit the: September 2011,"Ans. D: Caecum Adult Enterobius vermicularis worms inhabit the caecum, appendix and adjacent poions of the ascending colon, lying closely applied to the mucosal surface. Pinworm (genus En terobius)/Threadworm/Seatworm, It is a nematode (roundworm) and a common human intestinal parasite, especially in children. It inhabits the caecum, appendix and adjacent poion of the ascending colon, lying closely applied to the mucosal surface It causes enterobiasis, or less precisely as oxyuriasis in reference to the family Oxyuridae. The pinworm appears as a white, small and delicate nematode. The adult female has a sharply pointed posterior end, is 8 to 13 millimeters long, and 0.5 millimeter thick. The adult male is considerably smaller, measuring 2 to 5 millimeters long and 0.2 millimeter thick, and has a curved posterior end. The eggs are translucent and have a surface that adheres to environmental objects. The eggs measure 50 to 60 micrometers by 20 to 30 micrometers, and have a thick shell that is flattened on one side. The small size and colorlessness of the eggs make them invisible to the naked eye, except in barely visible clumps of thousands of eggs. Eggs may contain a developing embryo or a fully developed pinworm larva.Inside the host, the larvae grow to 140-150 micrometers in length Pinworms spread through human-to-human transmission, by ingesting (i.e., swallowing) infectious pinworm eggs and/or by anal sex. The eggs are hardy and can remain ble (i.e., infectious) in a moist environment for up to three weeks.They do not tolerate heat well, but can survive in low temperatures: two-thirds of the eggs are still ble after 18 hours at -8 degrees Celsius (18 degF). After the eggs have been initially deposited near the anus, they are readily transmitted to other surfaces through contamination. The surface of the eggs is sticky when laid, and the eggs are readily transmitted from their initial deposit near the anus to fingernails, hands, night-clothing and bed linen.From here, eggs are fuher transmitted to food, water, furniture, toys, bathroom fixtures and other objects.Household pets often carry the eggs in their fur, while not actually being infected. Dust containing eggs can become airborne and widely dispersed when dislodged from surfaces, for instance when shaking out bed clothes and linen.Consequently the eggs can enter the mouth and nose through inhalation, and be swallowed later. Although pinworms do not strictly multiply inside the body of their human host, some of the pinworm larvae may hatch on the anal mucosa, and migrate up the bowel and back into the gastrointestinal tract of the original host. This process is called retroinfection. Despite the limited, 13 week lifespan of individual pinworms, autoinfection (i.e., infection from the original host to itself), either through the anus-to-mouth route or through retroinfection, causes the pinworms to inhabit the same host indefinitely",Microbiology,,Caecum

Storage form of thyroid hormone-,"The synthesis and storage of thyroid hormones occurs between the follicular cells and the colloid. The storage form of thyroid hormone is thyroglobulin. Thyroglobulin is a large glycoprotein synthesized in the follicular cells and has a molecular weight of around 650 000 with about 140 tyrosine residues, depending on the form of thyroglobulin. Approximately one quaer of these residues is iodinated at the apical-colloid interface. Once iodinated, thyroglobulin is taken up into the colloid of the follicle where, still incorporated in the protein, a coupling reaction between pairs of iodinated tyrosine molecules occurs. The coupling of two tyrosine residues each iodinated at two positions (di-iodotyrosine, DIT) produces tetra-iodothyronine or thyroxine (T4 ) whilst the combination of DIT with mono-iodotyrosine (MIT) produces tri-iodothyronine (T3 ). Such coupling can occur within a single molecule of thyroglobulin or between dimerized molecules of the protein. This coupling is catalyzed by TPO. Thyroid hormones are stored in this state and are only released when the thyroglobulin molecule is taken back up into the follicular cells. Stimulated by TSH, thyroglobulin droplets are captured by the follicular cells by a process of pinocytosis. Fusion of the droplets with lysosomes results in hydrolysis of the thyroglobulin molecules and release of T3 and T4.

MHC restriction is a pa of all except aEUR',"Autoimmune disorder Major histocompatibility complex : Major histocompatibility complex, also called the human leucocyte antigen (HLA) complex is a 4 megahase region on chromosome 6. This region is densely packed with genes. These genes encodes two major proteins or antigens i.e., MHC I & MHC II. These proteins play an impoant role in the differentiation of foreign cells from host cell. Presence of these proteins is necessary for identification of host cells. Identification of the cells is impoant for immune responses. If the cell is recognised as self, the immune system will not mount an immune response against it. How does MHC helps in this ??? Cells continuously display small pieces of their own internal protein, carrying them, outsie the cell membrane where the immune system can see them. These peptides are just pieces of the normal proteins found inside the cell. These peptides are held together at the cell surface by major histocompatibility complex, which holds these peptides together for the immune system to examine them. Each persons immune system is customized early in life to ignore these peptides, so healthy cells are not able to trigger the immune system and they are left alone. But if any virus or other microorganism is multiplying inside the cell, the peptides synthesized by it also is displayed on the surface. The MHC displays these unusual (foreign) protein on the surface of the cell. The immune system is triggered because of these peptides, staing, a series of event that will eventually lead to killing of the cell containing foreign peptide. MHC is also the cause of tissue rejection during skin grafts and organ grafts. This is how the MHC protein got its name; the term histocompatibility refers to the difficulty of finding compatible grafts between a donor and a patient. Each person has their own collection of MHC molecules. If you graft a piece of skin that has a different collection of MHC types they will trigger the immune system to destroy the cell. So a compatible donor is needed such as a relative who has a similar collection of MHC molecules. MHC is also active against cancer Cancer cells, like normal cells, display pieces of their own protein on their surface. So if any of these proteins carries recognizable cancer mutations, this provides a signal to the immune system that something is wrong and the cell is killed. MHC plays role in activation of T helper cells (Th) MHC class II molecules are present on the membranes of dendritic cells, macrophages. These cell function as antigen presenting cell during immune response. They capture the antigen and present it to T helper cells. In response, the T helper cells secrete cytokines that stimulate B cell proliferation and antibody production. The impoant point about T helper cells is that they respond to only those antigens which have been presented to them by cells that have host matching MHC complex on the presenting cell. In general the antigen presenting cell .first phagocytoses the protein antigen and cleaves it to peptides in the lysosomes. These peptides are then extruded and attached to the presenting cell's surface MHC complex. T helper cells first, make sure, that these MHC class II molecules are host's own MHC and then responds appropriately. So, we can say that receptor on the T helper cell is thus responsive to the combination of antigen and host matching MHC complex on the presenting cell.

During cardiac imaging the phase of minimum motion of hea is:,"D i.e. Mid diastole- During cardiac imaging (such as MRI, CT, electron beam tomography), mid diastolic phase (or diastasis) of cardiac cycle is usually (but not always) associated with lowest (minimum) mean motion of hea.Q- Optimum phase (i.e. with minimum cardiac motion) for cardiac and coronary vessel imaging is mid-diastole (diastasis) at low or intermediate hea rates; but is variable and may occur in late systole at high hea rates.Cardiac Motion and Imaging- Radiological imaging by CT and MRI can detect coronary aery disease in early stage. However, the use of these tools to cardiac imaging is severely limited because of motion aifacts produced by constantly in motion hea completing an entire cycle of contraction and relaxation in about 1 second.- So radiological cardiac imaging requires a 'window' of minimum cardiac motion to reduce motion aifacts and achieve meaningful images. The phase of minimum cardiac motion is although variable and depends on several factors especially hea rate and the chamber (i.e. right /left - atrium or ventricle) to be specifically imaged. However, the phase of minimum cardiac motion (= optimum phase for cardiac & coronary vessel imaging).",Physiology,,Mid diastole

On the fouh day in hospital, he develops severe midabdominal pain. On physical examination, blood pressure is 90/60 mm Hg and pulse is 110 beats per minute and regular; the abdomen is soft with mild generalized tenderness and distention. Bowel sounds are hypoactive; stool Hematest is positive. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in this patient's management?","In the absence of peritoneal signs, angiography is the diagnostic test of choice for acute mesenteric ischemia. Patients with peritoneal signs should undergo emergent laparotomy. Acute mesenteric ischemia may be difficult to diagnose. The condition should be suspected in patients with either systemic manifestations of aeriosclerotic vascular disease or low cardiac-output states associated with a sudden development of abdominal pain that is out of propoion to the physical findings. Because of the risk of progression to small-bowel infarction, acute mesenteric ischemia is an emergency and timely diagnosis is essential. Although patients may have lactic acidosis or leukocytosis, these are late findings. Abdominal films are generally unhelpful and may show a nonspecific ileus pattern. Since the pathology involves the small bowel, a barium enema is not indicated. Upper gastrointestinal series and ultrasonography are also of limited value. CT scanning is a good initial test, but should still be followed by angiography in a patient with clinically suspected acute mesenteric ischemia, even in the absence of findings on the CT scan. In addition to establishing the diagnosis in this stable patient, angiography may also assist with operative planning and elucidation of the etiology of the acute mesenteric ischemia. The cause may be embolic occlusion or thrombosis of the superior mesenteric aery, primary mesenteric venous occlusion, or nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia secondary to low-cardiac output states. A moality of 50% to 75% is repoed. The majority of affected patients are at high operative risk, but early diagnosis followed by revascularization or resectional surgery or both are the only hope for survival. Celiotomy must be performed once the diagnosis of aerial occlusion or bowel infarction has been made. Initial treatment of nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia includes measures to increase cardiac output and blood pressure.

It is about 10% of total activity and is increased in obstructive jaundice and to some extent in metastatic carcinoma of liver.# Alpha-2 heat labile ALP is stable at 56degC; but loses its activity when kept at 65degC for 30 minutes. It is produced by hepatic cells. Therefore, exaggerated alpha-2 band suggests hepatitis. This liver iso-enzyme forms about 25% of total ALP.# Alpha-2 heat stable ALP will not be destroyed at 65degC, but is inhibited by phenylalanine. It is of placental origin, which is found in blood in normal pregnancy. An iso-enzyme closely resembling the placental form is characteristically seen in circulation in about 15% cases of carcinoma of lung, liver and gut and named as Regan iso-enzyme (after the first patient in whom it was detected) or carcinoplacental iso-enzyme. Chronic heavy smoking also increases Regan iso-enzyme level in blood. Normal level is only 1% of the total ALP.# Pre-beta ALP is of bone origin and elevated levels are seen in bone diseases. This is most heat labile (destroyed at 56degC, 10 min). Wheat germ lectin will precipitate bone isoenzyme. This constitutes about 50% of normal ALP activity.# Gamma-ALP is inhibited by phenylalanine and originates from intestinal cells. It is increased in ulcerative colitis. About 10% of plasma ALP are of intestinal variety.# Leucocyte alkaline phosphatase (LAP) is significantly decreased in chronic myeloid leukemia. It is increased in lymphomas and leukemoid reactions.ALANINE AMINO TRANSFERASE (ALT)# It is also called as serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase (SGPT).# The enzyme needs pyridoxal phosphate as co-enzyme.# Normal serum level of AL T for male is 13^4-0 U/L and for female is 10-28 U/L.# Very high values (100 to 1000 U/L) are seen in acute hepatitis, either toxic or viral in origin.# Both ALT and AST levels are increased in liver disease, but ALT > AST.# Moderate increase (25 to 100 U/L) may be seen in chronic liver diseases such as cirrhosis, Hepatoma.# A sudden fall in ALT level in cases of hepatitis is very bad prognostic sign.NUCLEOTIDE PHOSPHATASE# It is also known as 5' nucleotidase.# It is a marker enzyme for plasma membranes and is seen as an ecto-enzyme (enzyme present on the cell membrane).# Serum samples contain both ALP and NTP.# These are distinguished by Nickel ions which inhibit NTP but not ALP.- Normal NTP level in serum is 2-10 IU/L.

Treatment of Choice in Sleep Apnea Syndrome:,"(A) Continuous positive pressure ventilation# Sleep apnea: Sleep apnea is a sleep disorder characterized by pauses in breathing during sleep. Each episode, called an apnea, lasts long enough so that one or more breaths are missed, and such episodes occur repeatedly throughout sleep.> The standard definition of any apneic event includes a minimum 10 second interval between breaths, with either a neurological arousal (a 3-second or greater shift in EEG frequency, measured at C3, C4, O1, or O2), a blood oxygen desaturation of 3-4deg/: or greater, or both arousal and desaturation. Sleep apnea is diagnosed with an overnight sleep test called a polysomnogram, or a ""Sleep Study"".> Treatment: The most common treatment and arguably the most consistently effective treatment for sleep apnea is the use of a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) device, which 'splints' the patient's airway open during sleep by means of a flow of pressurized air into the throat. However the CPAP machine only assists inhaling whereas a BiPAP machine assists with both inhaling and exhaling, and is used in more severe cases. Medications like Acetazolamide lower blood pH and encourage respiration. Low doses of oxygen are also used as a treatment for hypoxia but are discouraged due to side effects.",Psychiatry,Miscellaneous,Continuous positive pressure ventilation.

Ulipristal acetate is a/an:,"Ans. is d, i.e. Selective progesterone receptor modulatorRef: Harrison's Principles of Internal medicine 19th/ed, p2391Ulipristal acetate (trade name Ella One in the European Union, Ella in the US for contraception, and Esmya for uterine fibroid) is a selective progesterone receptor modulator (SPRM).PharmacodynamicsAs an SPRM, ulipristal acetate has partial agonistic as well as antagonistic effects on the progesterone receptor. It also binds to the glucocorticoid receptor, but is only a weak anti-glucocorticoid relative to mifepristone, and has no relevant affinity to the estrogen, androgen and mineralocorticoid receptors. Phase II clinical trials suggest that the mechanism might consist of blocking or delaying ovulation and of delaying the maturation of the endometrium.Medical Uses* Emergency contraception: For emergency contraception, a 30mg tablet is used within 120 hours (5 days) after an unprotected intercourse or contraceptive failure. It has been shown to prevent about 60% of expected, pregnancies, and prevents more pregnancies than emergency contraception with levonorgestrel.* Treatment of uterine fibroids: Ulipristal acetate is used for preoperative treatment of moderate to severe symptoms of uterine fibroids in adult women of reproductive age in a daily dose of a 5mg tablet. Treatment of uterine fibroids with ulipristal acetate for 13 weeks effectively controlled excessive bleeding due to uterine fibroids and reduced the size of the fibroids.InteractionsUlipristal acetate is metabolized by CYP3A4 in vitro. Ulipristal acetate is likely to interact with substrates of CYP3A4, like rifampicin, phenytoin, St John's wort, carbamazepine or ritonavir. Therefore, concomitant use with these agents is not recommended. It might also interact with hormonal contraceptives and progestogens such as levonorgestrel and other substrates of the progesterone receptor, as well as with glucocorticoids.Adverse EffectsCommon side effects include abdominal pain and temporary menstrual irregularity or disruption. Headache and nausea were observed under long-term administration (12 weeks), but not after a single dose.ContraindicationsUlipristal acetate should not be taken by women with severe liver diseases because of its CYP-mediated metabolism. It has not been studied in women under the age of 18.Pregnancy: Unlike levonorgestrel, and like mifepristone, ulipristal acetate is embryotoxic in animal studies. Before taking the drug, a pregnancy must be excluded.",Gynaecology & Obstetrics,Physiology & Histology,Selective progesterone receptor modulator
A patient presented with ahritis and purpura. Laboratory examination showed monoclonal and polyclonal cryoglobulins. Histopathology showed deposits of cryoglobulins around the vessels. The patient should be tested for which of the following ?,"Hepatitis C This is caused by an RNA flavivirus. Acute symptomatic infection with hepatitis C is rare. Most individuals are unaware of when they became infected and are identified only when they develop chronic liver disease. Eighty per cent of individuals exposed to the virus become chronically infected and late spontaneous viral clearance is rare. There is no active or passive protection against hepatitis C virus (HCV). Hepatitis C infection is usually identified in asymptomatic individuals screened because they have risk factors for infection, such as previous injecting drug use , or have incidentally been found to have abnormal liver blood tests. Although most people remain asymptomatic until progression to cirrhosis occurs, fatigue can complicate chronic infection and is unrelated to the degree of liver damage. Hepatitis C is the most common cause of what used to be known as 'non-A, non-B hepatitis'. If hepatitis C infection is left untreated, progression from chronic hepatitis to cirrhosis occurs over 20-40 years. Risk factors for progression include male gender, immunosuppression (such as co-infection with HIV), prothrombotic states and heavy alcohol misuse. Not everyone with hepatitis C infection will necessarily develop cirrhosis but approximately 20% do so within 20 years. Once cirrhosis has developed, the 5- and 10-year survival rates are 95% and 81%, respectively. One-quaer of people with cirrhosis will develop complications within 10 years and, once complications such as ascites develop, the 5-year survival is around 50%. Once cirrhosis is present, 2-5% per year will develop primary hepatocellular carcinoma. Ref Davidson edition23rd pg877",Medicine,G.I.T,HCV

"Marfans Syndrome affecting eyes, skeletal system, and the cardiovascular system is caued by the mutation in the gene","Marfan Syndrome Is Caused by Mutations in the Gene for Fibrillin-1. It is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. It affects the eyes (eg, causing dislocation of the lens, known as ectopia lentis), the skeletal system (most patients are tall and exhibit long digits and hyperextensibility of the joints), and the cardiovascular system (eg, causing weakness of the aoic media, leading to dilation of the ascending aoa). Abraham Lincoln may have had this condition. Most cases are caused by mutations in the gene (on chromosome 15) for fibrillin-1.Mutations in the fibrillin-1 gene have also been identified as the cause of acromicric dysplasia and geleophysic dysplasia, which are characterized by sho stature, skin thickening, and stiff joints.

A 7 year old male patient presents to the clinic for routine dental examination and has history of frequent snacking and sugary beverages. Intraoral examination shows multiple pit and fissure caries and subsurface enamel porosity manifesting as milky white opacity. Tactile probing should not be used in this case because of all of the following EXCEPT?,"Traditionally, dentists have relied upon a visual-tactile radiographic  procedure  for  the detection  of  dental caries. This procedure involves the visual identification of demineralized  areas  (typically  white  spots)  or  suspicious pits or fissures and the use of the dental explorer to determine the  presence of a  loss of continuity  or breaks in the enamel and to assess the softness or resilience of the enamel. Caries lesions located on interproximal tooth surfaces  have  generally  been  detected  with  the  use  of  bitewing radiographs. These procedures have been used routinely in virtually every dental office in the United States for the past 50 years. Tactile probing with an explorer is no longer used for caries detection in most European countries, and this protocol has now been adopted by many U.S. dental schools. The primary concerns that led to the discontinuation of the probing procedure were as follows:
1. The  insertion  of  the  explorer  into  the  suspected lesion inevitably disrupts the surface layer covering very early lesions, thereby eliminating the possibility for remineralization of the decalcified area; 
2. The probing of lesions and suspected lesions results in the transport of  cariogenic  bacteria  from  one area  to another;  and  
3. Frank lesions requiring restoration are generally apparent visually  without  the  need  for  probing.",Dental,,It may induce spontaneous bleeding

This patient's paraneoplastic syndrome is most likely the result of ectopic production of","Symptoms not caused by either local or metastatic effects of tumors are called paraneoplastic syndromes. Bronchogenic carcinomas are associated with the development of many different types of paraneoplastic syndromes. These syndromes are usually associated with the secretion of ceain substances by the tumor cells. For example, ectopic secretion of ACTH may produce Cushing's syndrome, while ectopic secretion of antidiuretic hormone (syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion) may produce hyponatremia. Hypocalcemia may result from the production of calcitonin, while hypercalcemia may result from the production of parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP), which is a normal substance produced locally by many different types of tissue. PTHrP is distinct from parathyroid hormone (PTH) patients with this type of paraneoplastic syndrome have increased calcium levels and decreased PTH levels. As a result of decreased PTH production, all of the parathyroid glands in these patients are atrophic. Other tumors associated with the production of PTHrP include clear cell carcinomas of the kidney, endometrial adenocarcinomas, and transitional carcinomas of the urinary bladder. Lung cancers are also associated with multiple, migratory venous thromboses. This migratory thrombophlebitis is called Trousseau's sign and is more classically associated with carcinoma of the pancreas. Hyperophic osteoahropathy is a syndrome consisting of periosteal new bone formation with or without digital clubbing and joint effusion. It is most commonly found in association with lung carcinoma, but it also occurs with other types of pulmonary disease.

Jones Criteria for Diagnosis of Rheumatic Fever Major Criteria Carditis Pancarditis, seen in 50-60% of patients, develops within the first 2 weeks of rheumatic fever. Pericarditis is evidenced by presence of a pericardial rub, myocarditis by tachycardia, soft S1, presence of S3 and CCF and endocarditis by the presence of Carey-Coombs' murmur (mitral diastolic murmur). Ahritis (60-75%) Flitting and fleeting type of polyahritis involving large joints with no residual deformity is seen in 60-75% of patients and occurs early in rheumatic fever. Jaccod's ahritis: Ulnar detion of 4th and 5th finger with flexion at metacarpophalangeal joints is the only residual deformity seen in rheumatic polyahritis. Subcutaneous Nodules Non-tender nodules are seen over bony prominences like elbows, shin, occiput, spine in 3-5% of patients and occur 3-6 weeks after onset of rheumatic fever.

The placenta secretes a hormone that is utilized in the early detection of pregnancy. This hormone is:,"The synthesis and secretion of hCG begins about day 6 of pregnancy, presumably from the trophoblast cells. Pregnancy tests utilize the measurement of hCG for detection of the embryo. Endothelial growth factor (EGF) is synthesized by the cytotrophoblast cells in the early placenta, then is synthesized by the syncytiotrophoblast cells later (6-8 week old placenta). EGF maintains the trophoblast. Relaxin is synthesized by decidual cells at the time of paurition and acts to ""soften"" the cervix and pelvic ligaments. IGF act similarly to EGF by stimulating differentiation of the cytotrophoblast cells. HCS is synthesized by syncytiotrophoblast cells and will promote general growth. It is essential in the stimulation of mammary duct proliferation in development of the breast during pregnancy. Ref: Barrett K.E., Barman S.M., Boitano S., Brooks H.L. (2012). Chapter 22.

Effective red cell diameter,"Answer: (C) Thalassemia minor anemia may present with normal RBC diameter (265-68-Hrshmohon 7th) (630= Rabbins- basis disease)Red blood cell distribution width (RDW or RCDW) is a measure of the variation of red blood cell (RBC) volume that is reported as part of a standard complete blood count. Usually red blood cells are a standard size of about 6-8 pm in diameter. Certain disorders, however, cause a significant variation in cell size. Higher RDW values indicate greater variation in size. Normal reference range in human red blood cells is 11.5-14.5%. If anemia is observed, RDW test results are often used together with mean corpuscular volume (MCV) results to determine the possible causes of the anemia. It is mainly used to differentiate an anemia of mixed causes from an anemia of a single cause. Deficiencies of Vitamin Bl2 orfolate produce a macrocytic anemia (large cell anemia) in which the RDW is elevated in roughly two- thirds of all cases; however, a varied size distribution of red blood cells is a hallmark of iron deficiency anemia, and as such shows an increased RDW in virtually all cases. In the case of a mixed iron and B!2 deficiency, there will normally be a mix of both large cells and small cells, causing the RDW to be elevated. An elevated RDW (red blood cells of unequal sizes) is known as anisocytosis. An elevation in the RDW is not characteristic of all anemias; anemia of chronic disease,hereditary spherocytosis, acute blood loss, aplastic anemia (anemia resulting from an inability of the bone marrow to produce red blood cells), and certain hereditary hemoglobinopathies (including some cases of thalassemia minor) all may present with a normal RDW* The human erythrocyte is a biconcave disc, 7-2 pm in diameter, and has a thickness of 2-4 pm at the periphery and 1 mm in the centre* More than 90% of the weight of erythrocytes consists of haemoglobin.

Signal from Baroreceptors goes to -,"Ans. is C Nucleus of tractus solitarius o Baroreceptors are mechanoreceptors that are located in the adventia of carotid artery and aorta, at specialized locations called sinuses. Carotid sinus is a little bulge at the root of internal carotid artery, located just above the bifurcation of the common carotid artery. It is innerv ated by the sinus nerve, a branch of glossopharyngeal (IX cranial) nerve. Aortic arch (aortic sinus) also contains mechenoreceptors (stretch receptors) which are similar to carotid sinus receptors. However, their afferent nerve fibers travel in the aortic nerve, a branch of Vagus (X cranial) nerve. o The sinus nerve (from carotid sinus) and aortic nerve/vagal fibers (from aortic sinus) are together called 'Sino- aortic nerves'. They, together, are also refered to as 'Buffer nerves' because they are the afferents of cardiovascular reflexes that buffer abrupt changes in blood pressure. o Baroreceptors are highly sensitive to any change in mean blood pressure. Sinoaortic nerves (buffer nerves) normally discharge rhythmically, synchronous with the pressure fluctuation during systole and diastole. They respond to BP changes between 70 mm Hg and 150 mm Hg. When BP rises, baroreceptors are stimulated and their afferents (through sinoaortic nerves) stimulate nucleus of tractus solitarus (NTS) which inturn inhibits the pressor area of VMC, i.e., Rostral ventrolateral medula (RVLM). This results in decreased sympathetic outflow and therefore decreases in vasomotor tone and vasodilation. Vasodilation brings down the BP. Thereby helping hemostasis. Activated NTS also stimulates nucleus ambiguous (cardioinhibitory center) of medulla, which increases parasympathetic (vagal) output, through vagus, that decreases heart rate. Reduction in heart rate reduces the cardiac output, which also reduces BP. Baroreceptor stimulation also weekly inhibits respiration, o When BP falls, for instance while changing the posture from lying down to standing, reverse change takes place. When a person stands up, his blood is pooled in the veins of lowrer limbs by the effect of gravity. Central venous pressure and venous return decrease, which causes a fall in stroke volume. Hence the systolic BP falls. As a result, the discharge rate of baroreceptors decreases leading to a decrease in the inhibitory' influence on the pressor area of VMC. Hence vasomotor tone increases, leading to vasoconstriction, and consequently an increase in BP. Simultaneously, the nucleus ambiguous of the vagus is also inhibited, increasing the heart rate and consequently stroke volume and eventually BP. Thus fall in BP due to change of posture is very brief (Transient).",Unknown,,Nucleus of tractus solitarius
Intrinsic factor of castle is secreted by which of the following cells in gastric glands,"The stomach also adds a significant volume of digestive juices to the meal. Like salivary secretion, the stomach actually readies itself to receive the meal before it is actually taken in, during the so-called cephalic phase that can be influenced by food preferences. The gastric secretions arise from glands in the wall of the stomach that drain into its lumen, and also from the surface cells that secrete primarily mucus and bicarbonate to protect the stomach from digesting itself, as well as substances known as trefoil peptides that stabilize the mucus-bicarbonate layer. The glandular secretions of the stomach differ in different regions of the organ. The most characteristic secretions derive from the glands in the fundus or body of the stomach. These contain two distinctive cell types from which the gastric secretions arise: the parietal cells, which secrete hydrochloric acid and intrinsic factor; and the chief cells, which produce pepsinogens and gastric lipase. The acid secreted by parietal cells serves to sterilize the meal and also to begin the hydrolysis of dietary macromolecules. Intrinsic factor is impoant for the later absorption ofvitamin B12 or cobalamin. Pepsinogen is the precursor of pepsin, which initiates protein digestion. Lipase similarly begins the digestion of dietary fats.REF: GANONG&;S REVIEW OF MEDICAL PHYSIOLOGY, KIM BARRETT, HEDDWEN BROOKS, SCOTT BOITANO, SUSAN BARMANTWENTY THIRD EDITIONPAGE NO:432",Physiology,G.I.T,Parietal cells

The syndrome that closest matches the features provided in the question is Waardeburg syndrome type-I. This is inherited as an autosomal dominant fashion and hence is the answer of exclusion. As the question does not provide us with details as to the sex of the three children, a sex linked inheritance pattern cannot be worked out. Also the combined presentation of an affected father, unaffected mother and one affected child among three children is possible with both an autosomal dominant and an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern. In absence of any more details, the answer to this question cannot be deduced through the exploration of various permutations and combinations. How both autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive inheritance can be responsible for the above combination: Autosomal Dominant Autosomal recessive (A-affected allele and a normal allele) If the disease is transmitted in an Autosomal Dominant then :Father (affected) will be either 'AA' or 'Aa' Mother (unaffected) will be 'aa' If father is AA and mother aa, the offsprings will be 1. aA - 100% affected If father is Aa and mother aa, the offsprings will Aa - 50% affected aa - 50% not affected The scenario in the above question therefore is possible autosomal dominant inheritance if father is Aa and mother is aa (A'-affected allele and 'a' normal allele) If the disease is transmitted in an Autosomal recessive form :Father (affected) will be 'AA' Mother (unaffected) may be 'aa' or 'Aa' If father is AA and mother aa, the offsprings will be 1. aA - 100% not affected, (but carriers) If father is AA and mother Aa, the offsprings will be Aa - 50% not affected, carrier AA - 50% affected The scenario in the above question therefore is possible with autosomal recessive inheritance if father is aa and mother is Aa",Medicine,,Autosomal dominant

Similarly, glycosuria may have renal as well as endocrinologic causes. Therefore, these two conditions cannot be considered diagnostic of diabetes. Gestational diabetes is diagnosed in women between the twenty-fouh and twenty-eighth weeks of gestation, first using a 50-g oral glucose load if the I-h glucose level >7.8 mmol/L (140 mg/dL); a 100-g oral glucose test is performed after an overnight fast.

Typical carcinoid syndrome (high level of serotonin) is characterized by high levels of 5HIAA. The measurement of 5HIAA is most frequently used for typical carcinoid syndrome. Most physicians' only use urinary 5HIAA levels / excretion rates however plasma and platelets serotonin levels if available provide additional information. Platelet serotonin levels (5-HT) are more sensitive than urinary 5HIAA levels but are not generally available. Atypical carcinoid syndromes (low levels of serotonin) may have normal or minimally elevated 5HIAA levels. In such patient's urinary levels of other tryptophan metabolites such as 5HTP should be measured. Elevated levels of urinary 5 HTP is suggestive of an atypical carcinoid syndrome.,Medicine,,5HIAA

Which of the following induction agent produce cardiac stability-,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Etomidate Effects of Etomidate on cardiovascular systemEtomidate has minimal effects on the cardiovascular system.It causes mild reduction in peripheral vascular resistance which may cause a slight decline in arterial blood pressure.Myocardial contractility and cardiac output are usually unchanged. Etomidate does not release histamine. Cardiovascular effect of Propofol:The major cardiovascular effect of propofol is a decrease in arterial blood pressure due to a drop in systemic vascular resistance (inhibition of sympathetic vasoconstrictor activity, cardiac contractility and preload).Propofol markedly impairs the normal arterial baroreflex response to hypotension. Sometimes there may be a marked drop in preload.Cardiovascular effect of barbiturates (Thiopental)The cardiovascular effect of barbiturates vary markedly depending on the volume status, bas line autonomic tone and preexisting cardiovascular disease.Normally, intravenously administered barbiturates cause a fall in blood pressure.Cardiac output is maintained due to increase in heart rate and increased myocardial contractility from compensatory baroreceptor reflexes.However, in the absence of adequate baroreceptor response (e.g., hypovolemia, congestive heart failure, b adrenergic blockade) cardiac output and arterial blood pressure may fall dramatically due to uncompensated pooling and unmasked direct myocardial depression.Effect of ketamine on cardiovascular systemKetamine causes central stimulation of sympathetic system which causes increased arterial blood pressure, heart rate and cardiac output. There is also increase in pulmonary artery pressure and myocardial work.Because of these effects, ketamine should be avoided in patients with coronary artery disease, uncontrolled hypertension, congestive heart failure and arterial aneurysms.",Anaesthesia,Anesthesia for Cardiovascular Disease and Surgery,Etomidate

Bone marrow finding in myelofibrosis-,"Dry tap is usually defined as a ""failure to obtain bone marrow on attempted marrow aspiration"". The diagnosis and management of many haematological diseases depends on examination of the bone marrow, which involves two separate specimens i.e. a cytologic and a histologic preparation.Bone marrow examination refers to the pathologic analysis of samples of bone marrow obtained by bone marrow biopsy (often called a trephine biopsy) and bone marrow aspiration. Bone marrow examination is used in the diagnosis of a number of conditions, including leukemia, multiple myeloma, lymphoma, anemia, and pancytopenia. The bone marrow produces the cellular elements of the blood, including platelets, red blood cells and white blood cells. While much information can be gleaned by testing the blood itself (drawn from a vein by phlebotomy), it is sometimes necessary to examine the source of the blood cells in the bone marrow to obtain more information on hematopoiesis; this is the role of bone marrow aspiration and biopsy.",Pathology,General pathology,Dry tap (hypocellular)

A patient present with lower gastrointestinal bleed. Sigmoidoscopy shows ulcers inthe sigmoid. Biopsy from this area shows flask-shaped ulcers. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment -,"This may be caused by haemorrhage from the colon, anal canal or small bowel. It is useful to distinguish those patients who present with profuse, acute bleeding from those who present with chronic or subacute bleeding of lesser severity .Severe acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding .This presents with profuse red or maroon diarrhoea and with shock. Diveicular disease is the most common cause and is often due to erosion of an aery within the mouth of a diveiculum. Bleeding almost always stops spontaneously, but if it does not, the diseased segment of colon should be resected after confirmation of the site by angiography or colonoscopy. Angiodysplasia is a disease of the elderly, in which vascular malformations develop in the proximal colon. Bleeding can be acute and profuse; it usually stops spontaneously but commonly recurs. Diagnosis is often difficult. Colonoscopy may reveal characteristic vascular spots and, in the acute phase, visceral angiography can show bleeding into the intestinal lumen and an abnormal large, draining vein. In some patients, diagnosis is achieved only by laparotomy with on-table colonoscopy. The treatment of choice is endoscopic thermal ablation but resection of the affected bowel may be required if bleeding continues. Bowel ischaemia due to occlusion of the inferior mesenteric aery can present with abdominal colic and rectal bleeding. It should be considered in patients (paicularly the elderly) who have evidence of generalised atherosclerosis. The diagnosis is made at colonoscopy. Resection is required only in the presence of peritonitis. Meckel's diveiculum with ectopic gastric epithelium may ulcerate and erode into a major aery. The diagnosis should be considered in children or adolescents who present with profuse or recurrent lower gastrointestinal bleeding. A Meckel's 99mTc-peechnetate scan is sometimes positive but the diagnosis is commonly made only by laparotomy, at which time the diveiculum is excised Primary prevention of variceal bleeding If non-bleeding varices are identified at endoscopy, b-adrenoceptor antagonist (b-blocker) therapy with propranolol (80-160 mg/day) or nadolol (40-240 mg/day) is effective in reducing poal venous pressure. Administration of these drugs at doses that reduce the hea rate by 25% has been shown to be effective in the primary prevention of variceal bleeding. In patients with cirrhosis, treatment with propranolol reduces variceal bleeding by 47% (number needed to treat for benefit (NNTB) 10), death from bleeding by 45% (NNTB 25) and overall moality by 22% (NNTB 16). The efficacy of b-blockers in primary prevention is similar to that of prophylactic banding, which may also be considered, paicularly in patients who are unable to tolerate or adhere to b-blocker therapy. Carvedilol, a non-cardioselective vasodilating b-blocker, is also effective and may be better tolerated at doses of 6.25-12.5 mg/day). For these, dose should be titrated, as tolerated, to achieve a hea rate of 50-55 beats/min, if possible.metrandazole can be given sigmoidal ulcer Ref Davidson edition23rd pg 869",Medicine,G.I.T,Intravenous metronidazole

R-factor in bacteria is transferred by,"Conjugation

Bacterial conjugation is the transfer of genetic material between bacteria through direct cell to cell contact or through a bridge- like the connection between two cells.
Conjugation is a process whereby a donor (male) bacterium makes physical contact with a recipient (female) bacterium.
Donor status is determined by the presence of plasmid.
This plasmid codes for specialized fimbria (sex pilus) and for self-transfer.
Sex pilus (conjugation tube) helps in transfer of genetic material from male bacterium to female bacterium.
The plasmid is known as transfer factor (sex factor or fertility factor).
The plasmid may be R factory which codes for transferrable multiple drug resistance.
The DNA of the plasmid replicates during transfer so that each bacterium receives a copy → Recipient becomes a donor and the donor retains its donor status.",Microbiology,,Conjugation

Maximum FiO2 which can be given through a nasal oxygen catheter:-,"A nasal cannula is generally used wherever small amounts of supplemental oxygen are required, without rigid control of respiration, such as in oxygen therapy. Most cannulae can only provide oxygen at low flow rates--up to 5 litres per minute (L/min)--delivering an oxygen concentration of 28-44%. Rates above 5 L/min can result in discomfo to the patient, drying of the nasal passages, and possibly nose bleeds (epistaxis). Also with flow rates above 6 L/min, the laminar flow becomes turbulent and the oxygen therapy being delivered is only as effective as delivering 5-6 L/min. The nasal cannula is often used in elderly patients or patients who can benefit from oxygen therapy but do not require it to self respirate. These patients do not need oxygen to the degree of wearing a non-rebreather mask. It is especially useful in those patients where vasoconstriction could negatively impact their condition, such as those suffering from strokes.",Anaesthesia,Anesthesia Circuit,0.44

Preferred fluoroquinolone against m. leprae is -,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Ofloxacin Drugs acting on M. leprae* Established agents used to treat leprosy include dapsone (50-100 mg/d), clofazimine (50-100 mg/d, 100 mg three times weekly, or 300 mg monthly), and rifampin (600 mg daily or monthly. Of these drugs, only rifampin is bactericidal.* The sulfones (folate antagonists), the foremost of which is dapsone, were the first antimicrobial agents found to be effective for the treatment of leprosy and are still the mainstay of therapy.* Other antimicrobial agents active against M. leprae in animal models and at the usual daily doses used in clinical trials include ethionamide/prothionamide; the aminoglycosides streptomycin, kanamycin, and amikacin (but not gentamicin or tobramycin); minocycline; clarithromycin; and several fluoroquinolones, particularly preferred is ofloxacin.* Next to rifampin, minocycline, clarithromycin, and ofloxacin appear to be most bactericidal for M. leprae, but these drugs have not been used extensively in leprosy control programs.

A 70-year-old man comes to casualty with urinary retention and back pain. Which investigation should be performed -,"pt. is suspected to have Ca Prostate as Prostatic Ca is the most common malignant tumor in men over 65 yrs. of age. Symptoms of Bladder outlet obstruction and back pains (due to bony metastasis in the pelvis & lumbar veebra) indicate towards prostate Ca. Serum acid phosphates is a tumor marker of prostate Ca. But now serum acid phosphates assay has been superseded by PSA assay (Prostate specific antigen). Prostate-specific antigen It is a glycoprotein produced only in the prostatic cells (both benign & malignant). It facilitates liquefaction of semen. It is neither sensitive nor specific for early prostate carcinoma (it is prostate specific and not prostate cancer specific), neveheless it gives some help in making a diagnosis. Normal serum level - less than 4 mg/ml 4 - 10 mg/ml - this range is common for both BHP and Ca. More than 10 mg/ml - approx 75% will have cancer. Since PSA is not specific for Ca, PSA Velocity & PSA density is used to detect Prostate cancer. PSA velocity is the rate of change in PSA levels over time and is expressed most commonly as the PSA doubling time. For men with a PSA above 4, PSA velocity of more than .75 mg/ml year is suggestive of Ca. While for those with lower PSA levels, rates above 0.5 mg/ml, per year should be used to advise biopsy. PSA density is calculated by dividing the serum PSA by the estimated prostate weight (measured by TRUS). It was developed to correct for the contribution of BPH to the total PSA level.

Tumor suppressor gene p53 prevents carcinoma by?,"Ans. is 'd' i.e., All of the above * p53 gene is located on chromosome 17 & acts as molecular policeman that prevents the propagation of genetically damage cell. p53 gene product, i.e. p53 protein is a DNA binding protein in the nucleus, when called into action, it controls the transcription of several other genes.* When there is DNA damage due to irradiation, UV light or mutagenic chemicals, there is rapid increase in p53 levels.* p53 causes :-a) Cell cycle arrest: p-53 induces transcription of p21, a CDK inhibitor. p21 inhibit cyclin DCDK- 4 complex and there is arrest of cell cycle late in G1 phase. This allow time for DNA repair.b) DNA repair: p-53 also helps in DNA repair directly by inducing transcription of GADD 45 (growth arrest and DNA damage). GADD 45 encodes a protein that is involved in DNA repair.* If DNA damage is repaired successfully, p53 activate MDM-3 and this MDM-3 induce degradation of p-53 - Relieve in cell cycle block. If DNA damage cannot be successfully repaired, p53 induces apoptosis by inducing the activation of apoptosis inducing gene BAX. So p-53 prevents replication of cell with defective DNA - p53 functions as a critical gatekeeper against formation of cancer. Mutation in p53 leads to carcinogenesis because of loss of above protective mechanism.",Pathology,Neoplasia,All of the above

Histocompatibility and blood group antigens are good examples of codominant inheritance. ""--Robbins 9/e p140Codominance is a relationship between two versions of a gene, individuals receive one version of a gene, called an allele, from each parent. If the alleles are different, the dominant allele usually will be expressed, while the effect of the other allele, called recessive, is masked. In Codominance, however, neither allele is recessive nor are the phenotypes of both alleles are expressed, e.g., ABO blood group, where in AB blood group both A and B are dominant.""Codominance: When both alleles of a gene pair contribute to the phenotype. E.g., Blood group AB.ABO Blood Group SystemA and B antigens of the ABO blood group system are glycoproteins present on the RBC membrane.H substance is the immediate precursor on which A and B antigens are added.H substance is formed by the addition of fucose to the glycolipid or glycoprotein backbone.The subsequent N-acetyl glucosamine creates the A antigen, while the addition of galactose produces the B antigen.Bombay phenotypeIndividuals with the rare Bombay phenotype (hh) do not express the H antigen (also called the H substance), the antigen, which is present in blood group OQ.As a result of the absence of the H antigen they cannot make either the A antigen or the B antigenQ.These individuals have antibodies not only against A and B antigens but also against the H antigenQ.",Pathology,Mendelian Disorders: Single-Gene Defects,Codominance

The advantage of using a tooth positioner as a retainer is :,"The use of a tooth positioner rather than final settling archwires has two advantages: 

It allows the fixed appliance to be removed somewhat more quickly than otherwise would have been the case (i.e., some finishing that could have been done with the final archwires can be left to the positioner)
It serves not only to reposition the teeth but also to massage the gingiva, which is almost always at least slightly inflamed and swollen after comprehensive orthodontic treatment. The gingival stimulation provided by a positioner is an excellent way to promote a rapid return to normal gingival contours.

As a general rule, a tooth positioner in a cooperative patient will produce any changes it is capable of within 2-3 weeks. Final (post-treatment) records and retainer impressions can be taken 2 or 3 weeks after the positioner is placed. Beyond that time, if the positioner is continued, it is serving as a retainer rather than a finishing device-and positioners, as a rule, are not good retainers.

Volume cycled assist control mode of ventilation is the most commonly used mode of ventilation. Volume targeted modes deliver a preset volume unless a specified circuit pressure limit is exceeded. Its major advantages are capacity to deliver unvarying tidal volumes, flexibility of flow and volume adjustments, and power to ventilate difficult patients. Disadvantages of this type of ventilation are: Unless the airway is well sealed volume cycled modes cannot ventilate effectively and consistently.

Not a marker for hyperparathyroidism is :,Answer is C (Decrease in serum calcitonin) : Serum calcitonin is no marker fir hyperparathyroidism. It antagonizes the actions of parathyroid hormone and may be used as a modality of treatment of hypercalcemia secondary to hyperparathyroidism. Markers of hyperparathyroidism (|ed PTH): 1. Increased serum calcium: Stimulates Vit D which causes increased absorption of Ca-H- from gut Increased calcium reabsorption from tubules Increases osteoblastic activity in bones and mobilizes calcium from bone into serum. 2. Decreased serum phosphorus: - PTH acts on tubules to increase excretion of phosphorus. 3. Increased 24 hr urine calcium: - Despite increased reabsorption of Ca++ in renal tubules urinary calcium is increased owing to increased filtration of calcium in glomerular filtrate. 4. Increased Alkaline phosphatase: -Increased resorption of bone leads to compensatory elevation of osteoblastic activity 5.

Xerophthalmia caused by a severe vitamin A deficiency is described by pathologic dryness of the conjunctiva and * cornea. The conjunctiva becomes dry, thick and wrinkled. If untreated, it can lead to corneal ulceration and ultimately to blindness as a result of corneal damage. Xerophthalmia is a term that usually implies a destructive dryness of the conjunctival epithelium due to dietary vitamin A deficiency -- a rare condition in developed countries, but still causing much damage in developing countries. Other forms of dry eye are associated with aging, poor lid closure, scarring from previous injury, or autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid ahritis and SjOgren's syndrome, and these can all cause chronic conjunctivitis. Radioiodine therapy can also induce xerophthalmia, often transiently Xerophthalmia from hypovitaminosis A is specifically due to lack of the hormone-like vitamin A metabolite retinoic acid Treatment can occur in two ways: treating symptoms and treating the deficiency. Treatment of symptoms usually includes use of aificial tears in the form of eye drops, increasing the humidity of the environment with humidifiers, and wearing wrap around glasses when outdoors. Treatment of the deficiency can be accomplished with a Vitamin A or multivitamin supplement or by eating foods rich in Vitamin A. Treatment with supplements and/or diet can be successful until the disease progresses as far as corneal ulceration, at which point only an extreme surgery can offer a chance of returning sight.",Social & Preventive Medicine,,110 mg orally on two successive days

Which is NOT used in treatment of heroin dependence?,"Ans. is 'a' i.e., Disulfiram o Heroin is diamorphine and is 3 times more potent than morphine.Treatment of morphine or heroin poisoningo Treatment can be divided into:-A. Treatment of toxicity (overdose)# Overdose is a medical emergency, and is treated with opioid antagonist to reverse the complications (respiratory depression) by antagonizing the action on opioid receptors. Intravenous naloxone is the antagonist of choince for morphine (heroin) poisoning. Oral naltrexone is used for maintenance therapy, once acute poisoning has been treated by iv naloxone. Intravenous nalmefene is another specific antagonist.B. Treatment of dependence# Treatment of dependence include medically supervised withdrawal and detoxification, followed by maintenance therapy.a) Detoxificationo Detoxification process include abrupt withdrawal of opioid followed by management of the emergent withdrawal symptoms, i.e., treatment of withdrawal syndrome. Detoxification can be done by any of the following.1. Substitution of long-acting opioid agonism:- Methadone is the treatment of choice. Because of its agonistic activity on opioid receptors it suppresses withdrawal symptoms. L-alpha-acetyl-methadol/ Levomethyl (LAAM) is the other opioid agonist which was used for this purpose. However it is no longer in use because some patients developed prolonged QT intervals (torsades de points).2. Substitution of partial agonist:- Buprenorphine can be used in place of methadone because of its partial agonistic activity on opioid receptor.3. Substitution by a2 agonists:- Clonidine acts as a sympatholytic agent due to its agonistic action on central presynaptic a2 receptors which reduce nor-adrenergic activity. Therefore, clonidine reduces the adrenergic withdrawal symptoms. Lofexidine another a2 agonist, is an alternative to clonidine.4. Clonidine plus naltrexone:- A more rapid detoxification can occur when clonidine is used along with naltrexone. Naltrexone, when given in opioid dependent patient, causes withdrawal symptoms because of its antagonistic action. These can be treated with clonidine. The addition of short acting Benzodiazepine (lorazepam or oxazepam) and NSAIDs, will help relieve withdrawl symptoms not covered by clonidine. It should be kept in mind that naltrexone should not be used alone for detoxification (to treat withdrawl syptoms) as it precipitates or worsens the withdrawl syndrome.5. Other drugs:- Dextropropoxyphene, diphenoxylateb) M aintenance therapyo Once detoxification phase is over (i.e., withdrawal symptoms have been managed), the patient is maintained on any of the following drugs to prevent relapse by reducing craving and preventing 'kick' or 'euphoria' produced by opioids (morphine or heroin). Drugs used are:-1. Methadone:- Reduces craving and 'kick/euphoria' from morphine or heroin because their opioid receptors are already occupied.2. LAAM and buprenorphine:- Similarly reduce craving.3. Opioid antagonists (naltrexone):- Naltrexone can be used orally to assist in the rehabilitation of exopioid abusers who are fully withdrawn (otherwise it induces an acute withdrawl syndrome). Naltrexone prevents relapse by discouraging substance seeking behavior - If a patient, who is on naltrexone maintenance therapy, takes an opioid, there is no 'kick' or 'euphoria' as opioid receptors are already blocked. Naltrexone can be used with clonidine as in detoxification.",Social & Preventive Medicine,Mental Health,Disulfiram

"A 44-year-old businessman presents to a physician because of a markedly inflammed and painful right great toe. He states that he just returned from a convention, and had noticed increasing pain in his right foot during his flight back home. Physical examination is remarkable for swelling and erythema of the right great toe as well as small nodules on the patient's external ear. Aspiration of the metatarsal-phalangeal joint of the affected toe demonstrates needle-shaped negatively birefringent crystals. Which of the following agents would provide the most immediate relief for this patient?","The patient has gout, which is due to precipitation of monosodium urate crystals in joint spaces (notably the great toe) and soft tissues (causing tophi, which are often found on the external ears). Colchicine reduces the inflammation caused by the urate crystals by inhibiting leukocyte migration and phagocytosis secondary to an effect on microtubule assembly. Allopurinol and its metabolite, oxypurinol, inhibit xanthine oxidase, the enzyme that forms uric acid from hypoxanthine. Therapy with this agent should be begun 1-2 weeks after the acute attack has subsided. Aspirin competes with uric acid for tubular secretion, thereby decreasing urinary urate excretion and raising serum uric acid levels. At high doses (more than 2 gm daily) aspirin is a uricosuric. Probenecid and sulfinpyrazone are uricosuric agents, increasing the urinary excretion of uric acid, hence decreasing serum levels of the substance.

Platelet aggregation is blocked by aspirin due to its action on:,"Ans. c. Thromboxane A2 (Ref: Goodman Gilman 12/e p868; Katzung 12/e p638; KDT 7/e p195, 6/e p186, 609)Aspirin causes several different effects in the body, mainly the reduction of inflammation, analgesia, the prevention of clotting, and the reduction of fever. Much of this is believed to be due to decreased production of prostaglandins and TXA2.""In platelets, the major cyclooxygenase product is TxA2 (thromboxane A 2), a labile inducer of platelet aggregation and a potent vasoconstrictor. Aspirin blocks production of TxA2 by acetylating a serine residue near the active site of platelet cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1), the enzyme that produces the cyclic endoperoxide precursor of TxA2. Because platelets do not synthesize new proteins, the action of aspirin on platelet COX-1 is permanent, lasting for the life of the platelet (7-10 days).

Which is the cause of hemolysis in G6-PD deficiency?,"Ans. is 'b' i.e., Oxidative stress * Normally RBCs are protected from oxidant injury by reduced glutathione. Reduced glutathione is generated from oxidized glutathione and the reducing equivalent for this reaction is provided by NADPH. This NADPH is generated in HMP shunt by enzyme Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, while oxidizing glucose-6-phosphate.* If G6PD is deficient, NADPH production will be reduced that results in increased susceptibility of RBC to oxidative damage because of unavailability of reduced glutathione. So, whenever there is oxidant stress, e.g. by drugs, infection or foods, hemolysis occurs. G6PD deficiency causes episodic intravascular and extravascular hemolysis.",Pathology,Blood,Oxidative stress

The cut surface is dry, granular and grey in appearance with liverlike consistency .The change in colour from red to grey begins at the hilum and spreads towards the periphery. Fibrinous pleurisy is prominent. Histologically, the following changes are present i)The fibrin strands are dense and more numerous. ii)The cellular exudate of neutrophils is reduced due to disintegration of many inflammatory cells as evidenced by their pyknotic nuclei. The red cells are also fewer. The macrophages begin to appear in the exudate. iii)The cellular exudate is often separated from the septal walls by a thin clear space. iv)The organisms are less numerous and appear as degenerated forms.",Pathology,Respiratory system,Accumulation of fibrin
